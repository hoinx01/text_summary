by ethnic minorities.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="2" sums="30,5"><scu uid="14" label="The Labor Department reported that Myanmar forces adult and child labor"

ethnic conflict is not uncommon; it's been documented in Bosnia, Rwanda, and, most recently, Indonesia.</line><line>But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have received little attention, in part because the rapes have been perpetrated in inaccessible areas.</line><line>The US State Department reported this year that Burmese troops &quot;continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and there were many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by soldiers.&quot;</line><line>According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (Burma), government troops have been abducting &quot;increasing numbers of women, including young girls and the elderly&quot; and subjecting them to rape and other abuses.</line><line>The Burmese Women's Union alleges that &quot;women have been raped in an organized and systematic way&quot; by the army.</line><line>A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of Burmese citizens in a US federal court in 1996 targeted the Burmese military junta and two oil companies -- Unocal Corp., then based in Los Angeles, and Total of France -- for abuses allegedly committed during construction of a natural gas pipeline in Burma, charging that &quot;girls and women have been raped in the presence of family members.&quot;</line><line>The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will hear the case next year; the junta was dropped as a defendent because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign government.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1"

opposition.</line><line>Rapes by the military typically occur during raids on villages; when women are abducted for forced labor; during encounters with victims of forced relocations in the jungle; and in coerced marriages.</line><line>Rape is systematically being used by Burma's military as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with human rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials.</line><line>Bolstering those contentions is a new report by EarthRights International, a legal rights group based in Washington and Thailand, that accuses Burma's military of &quot;the savage domination of women outside the scope of acceptable wartime conduct.&quot;</line><line>The report also says that &quot;the violent sexual abuse of ethnic Burmese women at the hands of the military occurs in epidemic proportions.&quot;</line><line>Activists are urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to investigate the claims of systematic rape.</line><line>Thaung Tun, deputy chief of mission at the Burmese embassy in Washington, denies there is anything to investigate.</line><line>&quot;It is hardly possible for rape to occur in Myanmar on a policy basis.</line><line>Maybe on an individual basis.</line><line>But if it happens, there are laws in place, and people would be punished.&quot;</line><line>Many of Burma's soldiers are teenagers, often abducted by the army.</line><line>According to EarthRights, they are given little food, forbidden contact with their families, and forced to beat each other for punishment.</line><line>Abused physically and humiliated every day, the young recruits are then set loose among the ethnic minorities they have been indoctrinated to believe are &quot;the people's enemy&quot; and &quot;internal destructionists.&quot;</line><line>Many ethnic leaders and pro-democracy activists claim that the violence against women is directly related to the military's goal of wiping out all ethnic resistance, even if it means genocide against a particular minority.</line><line>One widely circulated document -- whose origin remains unverified -- appears to lend credence to the claims that rape is a conscious tool of war in Burma.</line><line>Marked &quot;top secret&quot; and dated only a few weeks after the military takeover in 1988, the document is addressed to &quot;All Great Ruling Burmans&quot; and outlines a policy of &quot;blood mixing&quot; and &quot;Burmanization&quot; of ethnic minorities -- a reference to the process by which Burmans, who now represent two-thirds of Burma's population, could become more dominant.</line><line>The document says &quot;the easiest way to implement these ideas is to occupy (marry or impregnate) women who are not Burman,&quot; for which it offers a financial reward.</line><line>&quot;We must deviously attack those who are not Burman in economic as well as social ways,&quot; the document states.</line><line>In Burma, children are considered to bear the ethnicity of the father only.</line><line>Burmese opposition leader Sein Win -- an elected member of the Burmese parliament who now heads the country's government in exile -- believes the document originated in the defense ministry's department of psychological warfare.</line><line>&quot;Regardless of the source or intent of this document, it accurately represents an ethnic cleansing policy of the Burmese military,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;There is no doubt that the widespread rapes by troops are fueled by the policies expressed in this document.&quot;</line><line>U Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications between two Burmese military commanders.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="5"/></line><line>Ka Hsaw Wa, a veteran Karen human rights investigator who organizes fact-finding missions for Human Rights Watch, says he encountered the &quot;Burmanization&quot; document in the Shan, Karen, and Karenni areas, where his sources retrieved it from Burman soldiers and outposts.</line><line>Although it is impossible to gather precise statistics about the incidence of rape as a tool of the Burmese military -- geographical, military, and cultural barriers make that impossible, say human rights workers -- anecdotal evidence continues to mount.</line><line>In April, Amnesty International reported that a 30-year-old mother, Nang Ing, was raped by three soldiers who accused her of giving rice to the insurgents.</line><line>After the assault, they poured boiling water over her.</line><line>She died three days later.</line><line>In another village, a woman named Naing Mai was raped over five days by military personnel.</line><line>She was then burned to death, according to the account that local farmers, who watched from hiding places, later gave Amnesty International.</line><line>According to a report last month from the Shan Human Rights Foundation, Aye Nang, another young mother of three, was raped by troops on March 5 in the village of Wan Pek.</line><line>She was then stabbed four times in the chest and buried in a shallow grave, uncovered by villagers three days later.</line><line>Jennifer Green, staff lawyer with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, is convinced that the Burmese military is guilty of crimes against humanity as defined by the UN war-crimes tribunal in The Hague.</line><line>The tribunal, set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has declared rape a war crime.</line><line>&quot;The facts presented in (the EarthRights report) indicate that these acts of violence against women are both widespread and systematic, that there is a pattern of rape, and that civilians are targeted for political reasons or because they are part of a certain ethnic group,&quot; says Green, who is a cocounsel in the lawsuit against Unocal and Total.</line><line>&quot;There is a growing acceptance that rape is not just a form of humiliating treatment but is an extreme form of violence and should

nonviolence.</line><line>This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997, shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters.</line><line>A mob of thugs - some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars - surrounded the vehicle and smashed the windshield.</line><line>It was, the world press noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing to intervene.</line><line>Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a serious threat to your security.</line><line>What were your thoughts in that moment when your car was being attacked?</line><line>SUU KYI: It was quite interesting.</line><line>(She laughs.)</line><line>I was fairly detached.</line><line>I saw it all as an observer.</line><line>There were all these faces crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big gash in my windscreen.</line><line>I just said, &quot;Keep moving&quot; - I made the decision that we were simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to support us.</line><line>One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down and telling him not to be angry.</line><line>But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt to harm us badly or even kill us.</line><line>It is, of course, very serious.</line><line>But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious than the safety and security of the people in general.</line><line>Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that deal with Burma.</line><line>Is this an effective means of supporting democratization in Burma?</line><line>SUU KYI: Very much so.</line><line>We would like to see more of this.</line><line>It's consumer power.</line><line>It's good to know that the people of different countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help Burma.</line><line>I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the world on your side than the governments of the world, even if governments can be more effective in certain directions.</line><line>Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called &quot;Visit Myanmar Year.&quot;</line><line>Are you still calling for tourists to boycott Burma?</line><line>SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way.</line><line>I still oppose &quot;Visit Myanmar Year&quot; and I'd ask tourists to stay away.</line><line>Burma is not going to run away.</line><line>They should come back to Burma at a time when it is a democratic society - where there is justice, where there is rule of law.</line><line>They'll have a much better time.</line><line>And they can travel around Burma with a clear conscience.</line><line>Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of heroin on college campuses.</line><line>Why is that?</line><line>SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in stamping out political activity than drug addiction.</line><line>Very few university students on the campus could get away with engaging in political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with taking drugs.</line><line>We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on the campuses.</line><line>Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes nicknamed &quot;freedom from fear&quot; - the same name as your famous essay?</line><line>SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by taking drugs.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="15"/></line><line>That would be very sad, wouldn't it?</line><line>Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially dependent on the opium crop.</line><line>Do you think crop substitution in the areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight addiction?</line><line>SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way.</line><line>But basically I think that in order to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through intimidation and repression.</line><line>First we would like to talk to the people concerned and discuss the problem with them.</line><line>That is what democracy is all about.</line><line>You talk over your problems with the people because the people are involved in the whole process of government.</line><line>As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over the world.</line><line>Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find other ways of earning a living.</line><line>Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma.</line><line>Reports describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one needle.</line><line>Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?</line><line>SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack problems at their source.</line><line>They seem to think that if they insist the problem does not exist, it will simply go away.</line><line>The best way to deal with AIDS is through education.</line><line>So we need a really widespread AIDS education program.</line><line>In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds - political, economic and medical.</line><line>AIDS education would be just one part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in our country.</line><line>Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?</line><line>SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want.</line><line>We all want justice and human rights.</line><line>Since what we want will benefit all the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.</line><line>Q: How much personal danger do you feel?</line><line>Have you been threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?</line><line>SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course the official papers are always talking about &quot;annihilating&quot; our forces.</line><line>(She laughs again.)</line><line>But we don't think about that too much.</line><line>There's no time to be thinking about such things.</line><line>(Leslie Kean, who writes regularly on Burma, is co-author of

there could be stepped-up activity in the coming two weeks by the opposition, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.</line><line>She has set Aug. 21 as the deadline for convening the National Assembly, which was elected eight years ago in a vote that was annulled by the military after her party won 80 percent of its seats.</line><line>Since then the military rulers have systematically harassed and

in an effort to force some liberalization.</line><line>&quot;There's a principle involved: yes, they want to have the election finally recognized,&quot; Wiedemann said of the Aug. 21 deadline.</line><line>But practically speaking, he said, the immediate goal of the opposition is to bring the country's leaders into talks.</line><line>The military leaders have said repeatedly that

political reform, released several prominent dissidents and ratified one international human-rights convention while promising to sign another this fall.</line><line>In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur to further openness and change.</line><line>Moreover, the Dalai Lama, among others, has praised the U.S.-China dialogue as an appropriate way to express American support for preserving the cultural, linguistic and ethnic heritage of Tibet.</line><line>Critics are right to say that this progress is not good enough.</line><line>That is why President Clinton spent much of his time during the Beijing summit working on the hard issues: urging China to do better on nonproliferation and political prisoners, pushing for more open markets, stressing that our improved relations cannot come at Taiwan's expense and making the case for democracy directly and compellingly to the Chinese people.</line><line>It would be presumptuous to suggest that our engagement alone will cause democracy in China to blossom.</line><line>China's future will be determined by the Chinese.</line><line>But our engagement can contribute to an environment in which the Chinese people have more access to information, more contact with the democratic world and less resistance from their government to outside influences and ideas.</line><line>It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success of our policy toward China or Burma.</line><line>In both cases, we hope for progress; in neither do we expect miracles.</line><line>Toward these countries and others where we hope for change, we must be patient and persistent.</line><line>And we must design our policies not with a cookie cutter but with the special characteristics of each in mind.</line><line>All this argues for flexibility.</line><line>There has long been tension between the executive branch and Congress over mandated sanctions, prohibitions, restrictions, earmarks and other restraints on foreign policy.</line><line>Having worked in both branches, I know that this tension is inevitable and, at times, constructive.</line><line>When I meet with foreign officials, referring to pressure from Congress can help to spur action.</line><line>What is not helpful is the growing tendency to view entire relationships through the prism of a single issue or to enact laws that deprive the executive of the leverage needed to bargain effectively.</line><line>The true challenge of diplomacy does not reside in the beauty of our goals.</line><line>Foreign policy is practical, not aesthetic.</line><line>It requires persuading others to agree to new policies and actions based on new understandings.</line><line>That may entail simple logic, economic incentives, technical assistance, new commitments, information-sharing, coercion, the threat of coercion, sanctions, the threat of
