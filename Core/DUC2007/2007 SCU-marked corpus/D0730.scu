after the Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be crocodile tears.</line><line>As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved in tax money.</line><line>Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes at $2 billion over five years.</line><line>Given that federal spending will be about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things.</line><line>It wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.</line><line>To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.</line><line>Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in tax revenues.</line><line>The magnitude of federal spending is so large that average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a practical way.</line><line>Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has been mostly from pork appropriations.</line><line>This makes the political calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="24,29"/></line><line>On the one hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.</line><line>On the other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it.</line><line>This is why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and reward allies.</line><line>Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="24"/></line><line>The bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about &quot;three slabs of bacon&quot; for each congressional district.</line><line>One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance, which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess contempt for it.</line><line>Although the line-item veto was a priority in the GOP's &quot;Contract With America,&quot; enthusiasm for it probably has waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="24"/></line><line>The degree of residual support will become more evident when congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional.</line><line>The response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.</line><line>Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of pork take?</line><line>Moore lists a few worth pondering.</line><line>This year's budget, for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.</line><line>Some $250,000 was appropriated for research on pickles.</line><line>New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a streetcar named Desire.</line><line>Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon to the local economy.</line><line>Business, civic and political leaders in Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators bringing home the bacon.</line><line>This is why some fiscal conservatives may be secretly breathing a sigh
