he said, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such treatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians and their clients.</line><line>&quot;The world is made up of a lot of very vulnerable and gullible people,&quot; he cautioned.</line><line>It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes to the vim and vigor of their hirsute - or, for that matter, feathered - loved ones.</line><line>According to the association, expenditures by Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and birds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied, from $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for inflation).</line><line>During that period, the pet population grew only modestly.</line><line>The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of alternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not cheap.</line><line>In New York City - where, granted, prices for most things tend to be highest - half an hour of acupuncture generally costs $50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms. Richard's healing waters costs $75.</line><line>Because treatments are usually repeated over the course of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high hundreds.</line><line>Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than just random experimentation more than two decades ago.</line><line>Racehorses were the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes surrounding the health of these animals were highest.</line><line>But in the last five years, the field has really taken off, drawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either integrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary practices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.</line><line>The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was founded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians.</line><line>The International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974, reports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is still a small fraction of all veterinarians.</line><line>Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary acupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being ventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats, dogs and parrots.</line><line>&quot;A friend of mine in California regularly does turtles - well, not the shell,&quot; Ms. Watkins said.</line><line>&quot;I know a guy in San Diego who is doing a dolphin.&quot;</line><line>There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to alternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product catalogs, many with their own Internet sites.</line><line>The Internet site for the Botanical Animal catalog provides a link to the Equilite line of herbal and floral elixirs for horses, including the &quot;Broodmare Blend,&quot; the &quot;Clear Thinking Blend,&quot; the &quot;Ego Builder Blend&quot; and the &quot;Mellow Out Blend.&quot;</line><line>Although pets being given alternative treatments are often following their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the other way.</line><line>&quot;I started going to an acupuncturist for stress because I saw how well it worked for Lola,&quot; Liz Santander, an interior designer from Chappaqua, N.Y., said of her 150-pound Great Dane as the dog awaited her latest treatment the other morning in the offices of Dr. Phillip Raclyn on the Upper West Side.</line><line>It was a busy, busy day.</line><line>While Lola, who was bouncing back from a stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame shepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.</line><line>A condition known as degenerative myelopathy had essentially paralyzed Ike's hind legs, which his owner, Chris O'Sullivan, straps into a two-wheeled cart so Ike can still chase Frisbees.</line><line>(&quot;I have to throw the Frisbee right at him,&quot; O'Sullivan explained.)</line><line>But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage therapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a particularly intimate, thorough petting.</line><line>&quot;Feel for the bony landmarks,&quot; Ms. Cooper instructed O'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in Chinatown.</line><line>&quot;Push away from the spine.&quot;</line><line>Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Raclyn inserted an acupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with kidney problems.</line><line>For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn; then another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin cushion.</line><line>Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.</line><line>A few hours earlier and a few miles downtown, Ms. Richard's patients were decidedly more agitated, slaves to a sloshy, invisible treadmill.</line><line>Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with Duncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about 35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for running.</line><line>Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu recovering from surgery for a ruptured disc.</line><line>The operation had left Sydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully regain.</line><line>This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked - as far as these things can be determined - appalled and terrified about taking the plunge.</line><line>&quot;He's a good boy,&quot; Lauran Walk, his owner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the surface.</line><line>&quot;He's a good, good boy.&quot;</line><line>Ms. Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village, said that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that Sydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.</line><line>But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and would do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was only a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.</line><line>&quot;He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a chance,&quot;

(pronounced &quot;chi&quot;).</line><line>In an exam room at the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine's Potrero Hill clinic, Sterling begins Soto's treatment by asking about his health during the past week.</line><line>He undresses, and Sterling runs her hands down his legs, where Soto has complained of pain.</line><line>When he responds to her touch, she calls out &quot;Liver 8&quot; or &quot;Spleen 1&quot; - points on his &quot;channels&quot; that are blocked.</line><line>She explains that the channels lose their &quot;moisture&quot; because of the HIV infection and as a result the energy is obstructed, causing pain.</line><line>This time, Sterling and an assistant insert and twirl half a dozen needles into specific locations on Soto's legs and feet.</line><line>Sterling says she can feel the needle interact with the qi, &quot;like a fish on a hook.&quot;</line><line>Some of the needles are then attached to a device that sends out an electrical current.</line><line>A few minutes later, Sterling uses an acupressure technique on Soto's chest and forehead, and then a cigar-like stick of herbs is lighted and passed back and forth over his abdomen, which is supposed to help ease his stomach problems, caused by taking more than 30 pills a day to control AIDS.</line><line>All of this happens while gentle guitar music overlaid on the sounds of the ocean play on a cassette player nearby.</line><line>To some, the theory and the practice seem fuzzy, and skeptics chalk up the many patient testimonials to the placebo effect.</line><line>The National Council Against Health Fraud's position paper on acupuncture says it remains unproven and its &quot;theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge.&quot;</line><line>Still, some studies have shown that there are physiological changes - including the release of the body's own natural painkillers, endorphins - during treatment, suggesting there may be something more at work.</line><line>&quot;More and more insurance companies are saying, 'Gee, there might be some literature to support this, so let's have it as a covered benefit,'&quot;
