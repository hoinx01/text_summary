with the drug's early trials in Boston and hinted there will be more good news ahead.</line><line>Addressing a standing-room-only crowd at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, Folkman, who developed endostatin in Boston labs, urged specialists not to be discouraged if the drugs don't work right away.</line><line>&quot;It doesn't matter if it takes a long time. . .,&quot; Folkman said.</line><line>Folkman was making the first public comments to cancer specialists about the drug's effectiveness since a National Cancer Institute official was quoted in the Globe earlier this month saying &quot;no dramatic benefits,&quot; have been seen in endostatin trials going on now in Boston and two other cities.</line><line>That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc., which makes endostatin, into a tailspin.</line><line>Investors have been closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman's progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman would cure cancer within two years.</line><line>That hasn't happened but the enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented as they await results of the endostatin trials.</line><line>Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study in October, two months ahead of the other centers, Folkman seemed to hint Monday that the drug's effectiveness improves over time.</line><line>Folkman, however, does not directly oversee the trials, from which no official data has been reported, and cannot speak publicly about them.</line><line>However, he said Monday &quot;We are very pleased with the results at the Boston hospital.&quot;</line><line>He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called angiogenesis inhibitors, of which endostatin is one, have proved to be powerful cancer fighters.</line><line>Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly, angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor's blood supply and slowly strangles them, or at least halts their growth.</line><line>Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients, mostly children, the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them.</line><line>&quot;If we'd given up in the first month or two, they wouldn't be around,&quot; he said.</line><line>One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all therapies.</line><line>She had been &quot;sent home to die,&quot; Folkman said, but after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor, the growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer.</line><line>The patient, Tonya Kalesnik, of Colchester, may be alive only because her doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt her tumor's growth.</line><line>In a telephone interview Monday, Kalesnik said she was in constant and excruciating pain, incontinent, and her legs were increasingly numb as the tumor grew.</line><line>Kalesnik's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually prescribed interferon alpha, an infection-fighting substance that is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor.</line><line>It is also effective in blocking a substance some tumors secrete, which signal the body to grow more blood vessels.</line><line>Kalesnik's tumor, called a giant cell tumor, was of a type that doesn't spread through the body but kills through sheer size.</line><line>Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it wasn't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the tumor seemed to have stabilized.</line><line>&quot;It was the first time it had done something other than grow,&quot; said Kalesnik, who is taking a break from her freshman year at the University of Vermont.</line><line>Over the next 18 months, the tumor shrank by about 80 percent, and Folkman believes she may be able to stop taking the drug within a few months.</line><line>Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly, in small doses over along periods of time, Folkman said the standard way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate.</line><line>In other words, angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment, but treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer, he said.</line><line>Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas.</line><line>Folkman showed slides of infants with enormous, disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood vessels.</line><line>These life-threatening growths, which also produce substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels, also responded well to interferon treatment, he said.</line><line>Previously, no other anticancer treatment had worked.</line><line>Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer.</line><line>Most have been inconclusive but some show promise that will be explored in wider testing.</line></document><document name="XIE19960522.0112"><line>China has started to put into mass production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat liver diseases.</line><line>Chen Zhangliang, the 35-year-old vice-president of Beijing University, declared at a seminar here today that recombinant a-1b interferon was approved for production by the Ministry of Public Health in April this year and has become China's first genetic engineering drug to be put into mass production in the biotechnology section of the country's &quot;863 Hi-Tech Plan&quot;.</line><line>China listed biotechnology among its top eight fields for scientific and technological development in 1978.</line><line>Biotechnology was listed among the top seven pioneering sciences in March 1986, when the &quot;863&quot;
