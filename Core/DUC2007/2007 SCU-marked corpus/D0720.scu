the Foreign Ministry.</line><line>It's about what kind of Israel, not what size of Israel.</line><line>Although he didn't set out to do this, no one is more responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</line><line>By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="2"/></line><line>It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal with Yasser Arafat, and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist.</line><line>It is no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian state while Likud rejects it.</line><line>Thanks to Netanyahu, there is now a loosely unified core of 75 percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a Palestinian state of some size or other.</line><line>With that sort of consensus in the middle, who cares who controls the Foreign Ministry?</line><line>Unfortunately, though, Netanyahu did not knock down the wall between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two sides.</line><line>He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it, while all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters that he was not abandoning their cause.</line><line>It may have been that the only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo, without triggering a civil war, was by Netanyahu winking, nodding, lying, blaming everything on Labor, the Ashkenazi elites and &quot;the leftists,&quot; and constantly bashing Arafat, whether he was living up to his commitments or not.</line><line>Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to as they accepted the inevitability of Oslo - and he accommodated them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who delivered it.</line><line>Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu: He brought a whole new segment of Israel into the peace process - but he stayed out of it himself.</line><line>That is, he never wanted to take ownership of it, and he still doesn't.</line><line>Bibi struck important deals that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner, but he still runs against him in this election.</line><line>In 1996, Bibi won because a majority of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo, the Rabin assassination and the blowing up of Israeli buses.</line><line>But thanks, in part, to his own real success at winning better Palestinian security compliance, a majority of Israelis now accept Oslo.</line><line>In other words, thanks to Bibi's having routinized the peace process, many Israelis want to get on with it, finish it and look to the future.</line><line>But instead of leading that parade, Netanyahu is shying away from his own accomplishment and running instead on the past.</line><line>He repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up in Jerusalem.</line><line>Because he refuses to embrace his own peace process, he is incapable of painting any positive vision of the future.</line><line>His campaign advertising is virtually devoid of any hope, and when you can't give hope, when you cannot educate, when you cannot articulate people's aspirations, when you cannot unify, you cannot lead.</line><line>I just received two e-mails from friends in Israel that sounded identical themes, although neither knows the other.</line><line>One was from a religiously observant friend who lives in the village of Zichron Yaacov, Victor Friedman (no relation).</line><line>Victor wrote: &quot;Even people who hate the left, and can't imagine voting for Ehud Barak, are tired of the kind of political and social atmosphere created since Bibi came to power.</line><line>The lying, trickery, corruption, divisiveness, incitement - people don't like it.&quot;</line><line>The other was from a Jerusalem-based writer, Laura Blumenfeld, who wrote that Israel today is suffering from &quot;Multiple Israel Disorder - Bibi thought he could hold onto power by dividing everyone into squabbling tribes.</line><line>He was wrong.</line><line>The shot that killed Rabin was like the starting gun on the race between factions.</line><line>But after three years of bumping and biting each other's necks, people are tired.&quot;</line><line>By breaking down the divide between Labor and Likud on peace, Bibi created the opportunity for national unity in Israel as never before.</line><line>But by doing it in such a divisive fashion, he has also created a longing for national unity as never before - a longing that he seems unwilling and unable to satisfy.</line><line>On Monday we will find out if Bibi can survive Bibism.</line></document><document

heavy load of memories of a homeland that was taken by force, leaving many of its people in refugee camps or under Israeli occupation.</line><line>Wherever he goes, Said finds fellow Palestinians being abused by Israeli settlers and authorities.</line><line>Their history, as he tells it, began with &quot;the catastrophe&quot; of 1948, when hundreds of Arabs were killed and thousands of others lost their homes and property to the conquering Jews.</line><line>In this hourlong BBC production, the prolific writer and scholar sets aside his intellectual credentials and makes little attempt at evenhanded reporting as he concentrates on his family's loss and on what he sees as the continuing afflictions of the Palestinians.</line><line>Everywhere, the camera finds symbols of Israeli power: the guns and bulldozers used to repress peaceable Arabs.</line><line>Missing from his account is any acknowledgment that there may be an Israeli side to the area's tumultuous history.</line><line>Despite expressions of sympathy from friendly Israelis, Said finds mainly oppression by Jews and indifference by most of the world to what he condemns as prevailing injustice: the years of expulsion, uprooting and destruction, with no alleviation in sight.</line><line>Arabs, he says, have been demonized, while the &quot;barbaric, inhuman&quot; actions of the Israelis go uncriticized.</line><line>Said holds out little prospect that the Oslo accords will do anything to improve the Palestinians' plight.</line><line>As he sees the situation, the new Palestinian authority is cooperating in holding down the indigenous population; the land of his childhood is gone forever.</line><line>The viewer need not accept Said's sad and bitter polemic as the whole story, affected

town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.</line><line>The senior cabinet ministers will meet again in a later date after the failure to reach any conclusions today due to the sharp disagreement between the ministers.</line><line>The new plan was presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard to the extent of Palestinians' control in Hebron.</line><line>Under the plan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would only gain the civilian control over the area, and the overriding security control would remain in Israel's hands.</line><line>Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull back from about 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab neighborhoods of the town under the full control of the PNA, designated Zone A.</line><line>However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be designated Zone A, but part of Zone B, an area of shared control, with the Israeli army permitted to move freely as it deems necessary for security reasons.</line><line>During today's cabinet meeting, Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy of the National Religious Party demanded that the Jewish community in Hebron be strengthened.</line><line>Meanwhile, Palestinian officials, having already accepted a delay in the implementation of the Hebron redeployment, repeatedly said that they would not renegotiate any signed agreement.</line><line>Early this month, Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Queria stressed that the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on the Hebron issue, saying the Israeli troops should pull out in accordance with the Oslo accords.</line><line>Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh also said that the Palestinians would not agree to Israeli troop patrols in the Arab neighborhood as part of an Israeli redeployment in the city.</line><line>Under the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed to pullback from of Hebron by March 28.</line><line>However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks, the redeployment was delayed.</line><line>Then the redeployment was postponed again due to the May 29 Israeli general elections for security reasons.</line><line>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said he has been studying the issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date when he would make the final decision.</line></document><document

held in Cairo in November.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="2"/></line><line>The ultimatum was issued by Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny at a press conference today.</line><line>Bassiouny said that Egypt demanded Israel to take immediate actions in implementing the signed agreements with the Palestinians.</line><line>The actions included redeploying Israeli troops from Hebron, conducting further redeployments under the Oslo accords, opening safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and lifting the closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas.</line><line>He stressed that Egypt wants deeds but not words from the Israeli government.</line><line>Bassiouny issued the stern warning only one day after Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy paid his first visit to Egypt, during which he held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and President Hosni Mubarak.</line><line>Moussa threatened that Egypt would cancel the Cairo economic summit if Israel fails to redeploy its troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, saying, &quot;I cannot imagine that the economic summit would take place when the withdrawal from Hebron has not happened yet.&quot;</line><line>Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed the Hebron pullout by late March, but it froze the plan after a series of extremist attacks killed 58 people from late February to early March.</line><line>The new Israeli government promised to conduct the pullout, but demanded certain revisions.</line><line>&quot;In the absence of implementation, it will be a very serious situation.</line><line>It is impossible to imagine that we can talk about regional cooperation when the peace process is obstructed or paralyzed.</line><line>It would be illogical, out of the question,&quot; Moussa added.</line><line>Levy said today Moussa's view was exactly that of Mubarak, who was responsible for issuing the ultimatum.</line><line>In a strong reaction to Egypt's threat, the Israeli government today warned Cairo against &quot;making things worse&quot; by issuing such an ultimatum.</line><line>The Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement blasting Egypt for issuing &quot;an unfortunate threat that can only raise the tension in the region.&quot;</line><line>An Israeli official pointed out that Egypt needs the Cairo summit more than Israel does.</line><line>Egypt is the chief Arab mediator between Israel and the Palestinians when the two sides held negotiations on the Oslo accords.</line><line>Although Egypt is the first Arab country that established diplomatic ties with Israel, the two states have been slow in normalizing their relations, which are often marred by the disputes over the peace process and bilateral frictions.</line></document><document name="XIE19970106.0021"><line>After an overnight secret meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed

businessmen in Tel Aviv today, Netanyahu said that some progress had been achieved at his meeting with Arafat which was held at the Eretz checkpoint between Israel and Gaza Strip.</line><line>&quot;We have made progress, but we still have not reached agreement on all the issues.</line><line>We will make sure that we will stand firm on the principles of security and reciprocity,&quot; he said.</line><line>Netanyahu said he was optimistic about reaching peace and security, adding that such negotiation required &quot;patience.&quot;</line><line>Today's surprise meeting lasted for over three hours and ended at seven O'clock this morning in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told Israel Radio.</line><line>He said that positive results were achieved in the summit, but there was still one major issue remaining unsettled -- the timetable for further Israeli troop redeployment in rural areas of the West Bank.</line><line>Arafat convened a meeting this afternoon of his senior advisers and some members of the Palestinian negotiating team to update his meeting with Netanyahu.</line><line>Noticeably, Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny also took part in the meeting to learn about the latest developments in the Hebron talks.</line><line>Egypt has been under fire recently from Israel, which alleged that Cairo was using its influence to encourage the Palestinian side to delay the Hebron deal so to extort more concessions.</line><line>Israeli and Palestinian sources all agreed that, with today's summit, the difficult Hebron talks that have been lingering on for three months seemed to have taken a positive turn.</line><line>The summit was the result of Ross' intensive mediation efforts as the U.S. is increasing pressure on both sides to wrap up the Hebron deal.</line><line>Under the Oslo peace accords, Israel troops should complete the pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank by September 1997 after the Hebron redeployment by last March.</line><line>Israel has delayed the Hebron pullback since the wave of Islamic suicide bombing attacks from late February to early March last year.</line><line>The Hebron deal has virtually been completed, but due to lack of trust between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority links the signing of the deal with Israel's commitment to further pullback.</line><line>It wants the U.S. to guarantee in a written form of Israel's commitment to the Oslo accords before it signs the Hebron agreement.</line><line>Meanwhile, Ross is continuing his mediation efforts today to bridge the remaining gap.</line><line>He held a meeting with Arafat this morning, and is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu late today.</line></document><document name="XIE19970914.0133"><line>Over 10,000 Israeli peace activists gathered in Tel Aviv overnight to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the signing of Oslo Accords
