he said.</line><line>&quot;We though this would bring the issue out more if we did it.&quot;</line><line>Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, &quot;No Life Til Leather,&quot; that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to bootleg.</line><line>It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes in rock.</line><line>Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its current CDs.</line><line>It now records for Elektra Records, a division of Time Warner.</line><line>Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing the bands money by sharing music online.</line><line>Rather, he said, those who have routinely copied music for each other on cassette tapes, or made illegal bootleg recordings at concerts, are merely taking the practice to a new medium.</line><line>He said Metallica had lost touch with its fans.</line><line>&quot;They're the No. 1 fan of George Washington,&quot;

says Jayson Maloni, a spokesman for the RIAA.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>&quot;Nobody is trying to keep an unsigned band from getting its music heard.</line><line>But the RIAA is concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not want to give away their music for free.&quot;</line><line>&quot;It's not just the artist.</line><line>You're messing with the record companies now and they don't want to lose that money,&quot; adds J.C. Chasez of the band 'N Sync.</line><line>The record labels have remained quiet and are letting the RIAA fight its battles, though more and more artists are speaking out.</line><line>The lesser-known ones tend to defend Napster, for as Bill Janovitz of Buffalo Tom says, &quot;For artists that nobody has heard of, Napster may help them.&quot;</line><line>But the bigger the act, the more likely it is to bash Napster.</line><line>&quot;I create my music; it's mine,&quot; said Reznor of Nine Inch Nails in a recent phone interview.</line><line>&quot;It's not your right to give it away or exchange it with your friends, just as it's not right to copy software or photocopy books to give away.</line><line>It represents the artist's work.</line><line>Just because a technology exists where you can duplicate something, that doesn't give you the right to steal.</line><line>There's nothing wrong with giving some tracks away, or bits of stuff, that's fine.</line><line>But it's not everybody's right.</line><line>Once I record something, it's not public domain to give it away freely.</line><line>So I stand behind Dr. Dre and Metallica and support them.</line><line>And that's not trying to be the outdated musician who is trying to stop technology.</line><line>I love technology.</line><line>Technology is here to stay and I'm the first one downloading the newest update to software that I don't need and that makes my machine not work.&quot;</line><line>As for Bizkit's Durst, Reznor blasted him by saying, &quot;Durst is the brain trust of all that is wrong with music.</line><line>He supports (Napster) because they gave him $2 million to tour.</line><line>He forgot to mention that in his press release.&quot;</line><line>(Bizkit was unavailable for comment since he's in the studio, said publicist Jenny Bodi.)</line><line>Singer Don Henley is equally outspoken.</line><line>&quot;The bottom line is this: The works of recording artists are being stolen and disseminated over the Internet without fair and just compensation for those artists,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;This is the way songwriters and singers make their living, and stealing that music and giving it away for free is not right.</line><line>&quot;Then there's the absurd argument that 'Well, rock stars are wealthy, and therefore, it's all right to steal from them,'&quot; said Henley.</line><line>&quot;But the majority of singers and songwriters and recording artists in this business are not wealthy.</line><line>They're struggling hand to mouth, day to day, and they need fair and just compensation for their work.</line><line>I'm deeply concerned, as are all artists about these issues, particularly Napster.&quot;</line><line>Napster was founded last year by Shawn Fanning, a 19-year-old then-Northeastern University student who dropped out after his freshman year to move to San Mateo, Calif., where the company is based.</line><line>Napster is growing dramatically - spokeswoman Deborah Orr won't put a figure on the number of users, but cites &quot;millions, with a 5 to 25 percent increase every day.&quot;</line><line>The firm refers to itself as the &quot;embattled MP3 file-swapping software company.&quot;</line><line>Clearly, there's a martyrdom complex here, though Fanning and other Napster executives weren't available to discuss it for this article.</line><line>Orr said, &quot;they can't comment on anything touching on the lawsuits.&quot;</line><line>Many observers say that the major record labels have been slow in climbing aboard the digital revolution, hence the fill-the-breach mentality of services like Napster and my.mp3.com.</line><line>Earlier this week Sony and Universal Music announced plans to launch a joint music download subscription service.</line><line>Meanwhile, a new company, myplay.com, has been working with labels on a &quot;totally legal basis,&quot; says founder David Pakman, who worked with Apple computer and is also a rock drummer.</line><line>His company enables users to have a digital locker of songs, but royalties are paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks but can't copy them.</line><line>Myplay will launch a partnership with aol.com in two weeks, so the timing is perfect for this new startup, now that Napster and my.mp3.com have been scarred by lawsuits.</line><line>While most artists have chosen sides in the Napster dispute, some artists are still sitting on the fence.</line><line>&quot;I can argue on both sides, but not hard enough to do anything about it,&quot; said solo and Throwing Muses singer Kristin Hersh.</line><line>&quot;I want music to get to more ears than just through MTV, Top 40 radio, and Rolling Stone.</line><line>So something that opens things up and makes people more musically educated can be a good thing.&quot;</line><line>A wait-and-see policy was voiced by Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins.</line><line>&quot;It's a waste of time to go after (Napster) because you're not going to be able to stop free trade on the Internet.</line><line>Everybody should stop wringing their hands about it.</line><line>&quot;It's going to take two or three years to sort itself out,&quot; said Corgan.</line><line>&quot;It's going to be the future, but we'll eventually have to figure out a system that gives the artist some copyright payment.</line><line>I believe it's hurting record sales, but it's also doing what it's supposed to do - building new fans.&quot;</line></document><document name="NYT20000510.0393"><line>Embattled software startup Napster Inc. said Wednesday that it has blocked access to more than 300,000 Napster users who the rock group Metallica said were swapping illegal copies of their songs.</line><line>But in an attempt to shift blame to the heavy-metal band, the San Mateo company said it would reinstate anyone who lodged a formal protest that they were mistakenly named by Metallica.</line><line>Reactivation of the account would take 10 to 14 business days as long as the band doesn't sue the individual first.</line><line>In fact, the formal online reinstatement request form asks the banned members to give &quot;your consent to be sued by Metallica in the federal court where you reside.&quot;</line><line>In a press release titled &quot;'Heavy Metal Heavyweights K.O. Fans,&quot; Napster attorney Laurence F. Pulgram said the company &quot;has taken extraordinary steps to comply with Metallica's demands to block hundreds of thousands of its fans from using the Napster system.&quot;</line><line>Metallica attorney Howard K. King said the band still had no intention of suing individual fans and that it was &quot;outrageous&quot; Napster was trying to shift blame to Metallica.</line><line>&quot;What this has done is let Napster fly its true colors,&quot; King said.</line><line>&quot;They don't have any intention of protecting copyrighted material.&quot;</line><line>The mass takedown of Napster users is the latest twist in the short but controversial history of the startup, which makes a popular software program that allows users to freely share and trade downloadable music compressed into the MP3 format.</line><line>Metallica filed a $10 million civil suit against the company on April 13 for copyright infringement and racketeering.</line><line>Napster is also fighting similar suits by rap artist Dr. Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America.</line><line>On May 3, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich hand-delivered 13 cardboard boxes filled with the screen names of more than 335,000 Napster users the band said claims were offering illegal copies of Metallica songs during the last weekend of April.</line><line>The band demanded Napster terminate access for those users.</line><line>The event became a media circus outside Napster's downtown San Mateo offices.</line><line>The next day, without fanfare, Metallica's lawyers transmitted an electronic version of the list to Napster.</line><line>The list was culled to 317,377 when Metallica agreed not to go after Napster fans who had copies of bootleg music that were authorized by the band.</line><line>Napster began blocking members on Metallica's list last weekend.</line><line>&quot;I was in shock last night when I saw I was blocked,&quot; said Jay Arnold of Tulsa, Okla., who added that he also felt &quot;betrayed by Napster.&quot;</line><line>Arnold said he has purchased CDs after hearing songs he sampled using Napster.</line><line>But now, he won't buy the latest &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; soundtrack because it contains a Metallica song.</line><line>&quot;They want to have this image of being rock and roll rebels and they do crap like this,&quot; Arnold said.</line><line>Banned Napster users seeking reinstatement have to sign an online form requiring their real names, addresses and a sworn statement they believe they were mistakenly blocked.</line><line>Napster will forward the forms to Metallica.</line><line>A Napster spokesman did not know how many users had filed forms but said it was running into the &quot;thousands.&quot;</line><line>Internet message boards were filled with posts from banned users who got back online simply by deleting Napster and any references to Metallica on their hard drives.</line><line>They then reinstalled Napster and signed on using another name.</line><line>Although the newest version of Napster keeps track of anyone who has been banned in the past, Napster users said they simply reinstalled older Napster versions that didn't have that function.</line><line>Ironically, the Napster controversy has made a team of Santa Clara University students $1,000 richer.</line><line>The four sophomore business majors, Kelly Walsh, Laura Erickson, Joseph Rushmer and Blaze Smallwood, recently won first place in a nationwide business ethics competition by suggesting a compromise to the recording industry's beefs with Napster.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>The solution called for the Recording Industry Association of America to drop its civil suit against Napster in exchange for a cooperative agreement with the software company that included Napster supplying demographic data on its users to the RIAA.</line><line>The Center for Ethics and Business at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles awarded first prize to the Santa Clara students.</line><line>Walsh said the students picked the Napster issue because it is particularly popular among college students, so popular that the program has been banned or restricted on about 100 campuses because of bandwidth or copyright problems.</line><line>&quot;The Napster Web site could actually facilitate the sale of merchandise or concert tickets,&quot; she said.</line><line>&quot;There's so much more than record sales.&quot;</line><line>Also, with the proliferation of Napster-style file-sharing software, the team sought to devise an all-encompassing solution.</line><line>&quot;It's a huge issue,&quot; Walsh said.</line><line>&quot;I might not go to Tower Records to steal a CD, but don't have a problem downloading an MP3 into my computer.&quot;</line><line>Napster suffered a legal setback in its case with the RIAA when a judge ruled it has not proven the company is protected by one provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</line></document><document name="NYT20000511.0294"><line>The US Constitution gives Congress the power to establish copyright protections &quot;to promote the progress of science and the useful arts.&quot;</line><line>This principle is as valid today as when the Constitution was written in 1787.</line><line>Congress and the courts need to adapt it to the Internet, which offers access to an extraordinary amount of information even as it provides opportunity to limit what people see, hear, and read.</line><line>Intense legal battles are being waged today over the use of MP3 technology, which allows the transmission of high-fidelity music in a compressed form.</line><line>Computer-users are able to amass collections of hundreds of songs on their PCs.</line><line>The recording industry might have embraced this technology as a new, more convenient way of getting music to its customers, but it has been slow to allow the release of material by well-known performers.</line><line>Several Internet companies, notably MP3.com and Napster, have stepped into this vacuum.</line><line>The Recording Industry Association of America accuses them of copyright infringement and has tried to shut them down or curtail their use of popular material.</line><line>The association has a point about Napster.</line><line>This program, available at no cost on the Internet, allows anyone who signs up to share MP3 files with any other Napster members.</line><line>Thursday afternoon, 5,423 Napsterites were on line with 621,881 songs (many of them duplicates).</line><line>Some of the music came from aspiring artists eager to be heard, but most was by famous acts, who would much rather have fans buy their compact discs so they could collect royalties.</line><line>Needless to say, most famous performers have not given Napster or Napster members permission to run a song-sharing service.</line><line>MP3.com had a better idea.</line><line>It wanted to create a database of 80,000 popular CDs and allow access only to people who could prove electronically that they owned, or at least had physical possession of, the actual CD.</line><line>The Napster case is pending, but Judge Jed S. Rakoff in New York federal court ruled last month that the MP3.com plan violated the recording industry's many copyright protections.</line><line>Both companies have since taken steps to reduce their legal exposure, but the larger issues remain.</line><line>Owners of CDs are not without rights.</line><line>Under the legal doctrine of &quot;fair use,&quot; first promulgated in 1840 and upheld repeatedly since then, people can make many uses of copyright material: using a portion in a book review, sampling a bit of a song for a musical parody, and making a recording for their own, noncommercial use.</line><line>This week heavy metal group Metallica forced Napster to ban 317,377 users from the service on the ground they had illegally copied Metallica songs.</line><line>But suppose someone owned the entire Metallica CD and just wanted to use Napster to make MP3 copies of a few tunes?</line><line>That ought to be considered &quot;fair use,&quot; and the MP3.com approach would have allowed this copying.</line><line>Even if the recording industry wins all its battles in court, new programs are being developed to allow the sharing of MP3 files.</line><line>Gnutella and other programs eliminate the key legal vulnerability of Napster - its dependence on central computers to facilitate file-sharing.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>The recording industry is pinning its hopes for protecting its wares on encryption.</line><line>The Sony Corp., which pioneered the Walkman technology that revolutionized music listening, has devised the Music Clip, a new kind of portable music player that forces users to convert MP3 files into a coded format.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>When Sony invented the Walkman, which played unencrypted tape cassettes, it had not yet bought the CBS recording company.</line><line>Encryption denies the buyer an opportunity to move the music into different formats, to combine selected cuts off CDs or to use bits for parody or other legal purposes.</line><line>It would seem to violate the &quot;fair use&quot;

the vocalist said during an interview this year at the South by Southwest music and media conference in Austin.</line><line>&quot;So many artists don't get a chance to be on the radio or MTV, or be on a major label.</line><line>This is how they get heard.</line><line>Why would you wanna deny them that?&quot;</line><line>For young people like Jennifer Cooper, an 18-year-old TCU freshman, it's a dream come true.</line><line>&quot;I've stopped buying CDs now because of Napster and MP3s,&quot;

Ulrich said in a statement on the band's Web site.</line><line>&quot;We know that the Internet is the future in terms of spreading your music to your fans, and we're excited about that.</line><line>But we want to control how that's done, just like we've always controlled what we make.&quot;</line><line>Napster officials say the company isn't breaking the law because it does not directly provide the copyrighted music, just a way to get it.</line><line>&quot;I'm a huge Metallica fan and therefore really sorry that they're going in this direction,&quot; Napster's founder, 19-year-old Shawn Fanning, said in a statement.</line><line>&quot;If we got the opportunity to explain to the band why Napster exists and why fans enjoy Napster, perhaps we could bring all of this to a peaceful conclusion.&quot;</line><line>Napster spokeswoman Deborah Orr estimates the number of people using Napster totals in the millions.</line><line>Users simply log onto Napster's site, do a search for a particular song and, when they find another user who has it, trade one of their tracks for the one they want.</line><line>With the click of a mouse, the songs are either stored on the computer's hard drives or transferred to CD via CD burners.</line><line>Something else that's troubling the music industry: Sometimes, Napster users get hold of material that hasn't been released.</line><line>&quot;I was talking to a friend and said, 'Hey, you wanna copy of our new record?'&quot;</line><line>Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas said in a recent phone interview.</line><line>&quot;And he was like, 'Well, I've already heard half of it.'</line><line>He got it all off the Internet.&quot;</line><line>Thomas is ambivalent about Napster.</line><line>&quot;If you're in a band that hasn't been as fortunate as us, that's who it's good for.</line><line>It gives them a chance to get heard,&quot;
