said Schagrin, who specializes in television-age collectibles like scripts and props from old shows.</line><line>&quot;As you enter the new millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century.&quot;</line><line>Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate, television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.</line><line>The &quot;Seinfeld&quot;

version that codified lines the actors ad-libbed.</line><line>Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes dropped before the episode was filmed.</line><line>Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10 billion market for collectibles.</line><line>Dealers say that prices for television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated 1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public awareness.</line><line>But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended the short-term hype for a particular series like &quot;Seinfeld,&quot;

he said.</line><line>Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; went for $1,150.</line><line>Once again, autographs were essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and his trainer.</line><line>Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than other film and television collectibles.</line><line>A script for an episode of &quot;MASH,&quot; signed by the entire cast, sold for $700 in 1995; earlier this year, it went for $4,000.</line><line>A signed script from the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; that sold for $550 in 1996 sold recently for $1,800.</line><line>And a &quot;Cheers&quot; script sold for $900 soon after that long-running sitcom went off the air in 1993.</line><line>The owner recently put it on the market for $5,000.</line><line>&quot;We didn't sell it,&quot; Schagrin said.</line><line>&quot;While we were working on it, he called back and said, 'Sorry, it's gone.'&quot;</line><line>In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the original proposal for &quot;Star Trek&quot; by the science fiction writer Gene Roddenberry.</line><line>The 26-page typewritten document describes the spaceship Enterprise as &quot;a wagon train to the stars.&quot;</line><line>Most of the characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the cameras, though: only Spock (&quot;with a red-hewed, satanic look and surprisingly gentle manners&quot;) made it onto the show.</line><line>Christie's East estimates that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; proposal will sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; script will someday bring.</line><line>Not yet, he acknowledged.</line><line>But not to worry, either.</line><line>&quot;They're going to replay 'Seinfeld' for decades to come,&quot;

he sketched this observation:</line><line>&quot;Most of you have seen this: a guy driving down the street with a mattress or box spring tied to the top of his car, and he's got his arm out the window and he's holding on to the mattress - with one arm.</line><line>Here's what this guy is thinking: If a big gust of wind were to catch the mattress and lift it, breaking the rope, he'll be able to hold the mattress to the roof - with one arm - and prevent it from flying off the car.</line><line>'It's OK; I got it.'&quot;</line><line>For his encore, Seinfeld spent several minutes taking questions and a few gifts from his audience: &quot;Will you do movies?&quot;</line><line>&quot;I don't think so.</line><line>You watch a bad movie, it only costs you two hours.</line><line>You do a bad movie, it costs you two years.&quot;</line><line>When a woman presented a bouquet of flowers to him, he said, &quot;Thank you very much.</line><line>But you know what most men think (when) they get flowers from a woman?</line><line>'Oh, great.</line><line>Now I gotta take care of these.'&quot;</line><line>He ended the show by following his own advice (to his TV buddy George): Leave on a high note.</line><line>After someone from the back of the balcony bellowed, &quot;Hello, Jerry,&quot;

they have now been erased.</line><line>NBC's ratings are off by more than 20 percent this fall, a figure surely higher than NBC expected when it calculated how badly it would be hit by the departure of &quot;Seinfeld.&quot;</line><line>Tellingly, the network's biggest losses have been among younger men, the biggest fans of &quot;Seinfeld.&quot;</line><line>Some of that is also the result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this year.</line><line>But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent.</line><line>Among men between 18 and 34 the figure grows to 31 percent.</line><line>That is the state of play that the new executive, Scott Sassa, encounters as he joins the network as the president of entertainment.</line><line>Sassa, 39, former head of all entertainment operations for the Turner Broadcasting cable channels, was appointed to replace the longtime NBC programmer, Warren Littlefield, last week.</line><line>NBC called the move the first step in a planned transition that would bring Sassa into total control of NBC entertainment operations.</line><line>For at least a year he will work under Don Ohlmeyer, the executive brought in the last time NBC, a unit of General Electric, faced a clouding-over prime-time picture.</line><line>That was in 1993, and things were much worse then.</line><line>Ohlmeyer, who is now widely credited with providing the leadership that turned NBC around, had to start almost from scratch.</line><line>NBC's executive reorganization this time comes at a far earlier point in NBC's ratings decline.<annotation scu-count="2" sum-count="1" sums="30"><scu uid="71" label="NBC's ratings fell sharply after &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ended" weight="1"/><scu uid="97" label="NBC struggled to counteract the loss of Seinfeld with personnel changes" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>Still, senior NBC executives acknowledge that they must make moves now to level off the network; and they believe they can.</line><line>NBC's position remains reasonably secure for the moment, because no other network is making a strong upward movement that would help force NBC down further, and because NBC still possesses a core of television's strongest shows - &quot;E.R.,&quot; &quot;Frasier,&quot; &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Law and Order.&quot;</line><line>But NBC is also embroiled in a bitter standoff with the Hollywood studios that supply all those hits.</line><line>NBC has demanded an ownership stake in all new programs and the studios have refused.</line><line>Instead, they have begun what is in effect a boycott of NBC.</line><line>For the moment, that means those studios will not be supplying NBC with any of the hits the network needs to pull out of its current slide.</line><line>NBC must have those hits because for the last three seasons, no compelling new program has been added to NBC's store.</line><line>Network executives concede that program development has been weak and no real hits have emerged in the last three years.</line><line>The strength of &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; along with the ratings garnered last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the problems for a time.</line><line>The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves, such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind of programming.</line><line>Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.</line><line>That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by the rest of the program department.</line><line>But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked.</line><line>Reflecting a widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing network suggested a couple of reasons for this.</line><line>&quot;It was a combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise and simple lack of execution,&quot; the executive said.</line><line>Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding, usually in New York.</line><line>The list of shows with that premise introduced by NBC during the last three years includes &quot;Caroline in the City,&quot; &quot;Suddenly Susan,&quot; &quot;Fired Up,&quot; &quot;Naked Truth&quot; and &quot;Veronica's Closet.&quot;</line><line>Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;E.R.&quot; - arguably the most advantageous place to build an audience for a new show ever created by television.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="9"/></line><line>But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.</line><line>&quot;We went with this cookie-cutter approach,&quot; one senior NBC executive said.</line><line>&quot;It just didn't work.</line><line>And it meant we wasted that 9:30 slot behind 'Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could help replace it.&quot;</line><line>Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced to move its next best comedy, &quot;Frasier,&quot; to Thursday at 9, where &quot;Seinfeld&quot; lived.</line><line>That did help shore up Thursday, which has been NBC's stronghold for almost two decades.</line><line>But in so doing, NBC drastically weakened Tuesday.</line><line>Thanks to &quot;Frasier,&quot; NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on Tuesdays.</line><line>Now &quot;Frasier&quot; is relocated and another longtime comedy hit, &quot;Mad About You,&quot; is fading in its last season.</line><line>With some stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.</line><line>Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one hoped-for new comedy, &quot;Encore!</line><line>Encore!&quot;</line><line>That is being pointed to as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of shows on the air.</line><line>&quot;Encore!</line><line>Encore!&quot; was produced because NBC had a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of &quot;Frasier.&quot;</line><line>But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged another promising comedy, &quot;Just Shoot Me,&quot; which NBC had hoped would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.</line><line>&quot;Encore!</line><line>Encore!&quot; is far from the only failure in the current fall crop, however.</line><line>One drama, &quot;Wind on Water,&quot; has already been canceled.</line><line>Another, &quot;Trinity&quot; (created as a result of a deal with the producer of &quot;E.R.&quot;), is endangered.</line><line>Another comedy, &quot;Conrad Bloom,&quot; is listing badly on Mondays.</line><line>Only &quot;Will and Grace,&quot; a comedy about a gay man living with a straight woman, has shown some signs of promise.</line><line>But that may only be because it has been up against weak competition.</line><line>When CBS broadcast a repeat of its best comedy, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond,&quot; against &quot;Will and Grace&quot; last week, the show took a big fall.</line><line>Still, NBC, because it owns &quot;Will and Grace&quot; and needs it to succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot now occupied by &quot;Veronica's Closet,&quot; another significant disappointment.</line><line>But several senior NBC executives said the network could not move &quot;Veronica&quot; until 13 episodes have been broadcast this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company, Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of &quot;E.R.&quot;</line><line>That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out its profitability for NBC.</line><line>The enormous cost of that deal hardened NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.</line><line>Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need to.</line><line>&quot;We aren't that dependent on the studios,&quot; he said.</line><line>Sassa, however, seemed to signal that he would take steps to resolve the standoff.</line><line>And another senior NBC executive said, &quot;Scott will solve that.&quot;</line><line>What Sassa will do to solve the drought of hits is less certain.</line><line>The cupboard is all but bare at the moment, with only two possible replacement series in production.</line><line>And neither of those, a comedy, &quot;Lateline,&quot; and a drama, &quot;Providence,&quot; is thought to resemble a cavalry charge.</line><line>Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being.</line><line>One show several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is &quot;Third Rock From the Sun,&quot; a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit &quot;Drew Carey,&quot; only to see &quot;Third Rock&quot; suffer badly.</line><line>NBC might also consider returning the Monday night made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing it with the ever-expanding news magazine &quot;Dateline,&quot; and dropping some of its weak Monday comedies.</line><line>But the movies that filled that slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get any stockpile of movies established.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="23,6"/></line><line>Ohlmeyer is expected to take a much more hands-on role in developing the next batch of NBC shows while Sassa learns the details of running the entertainment division.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="6"/></line><line>Sassa himself refused to say in what direction he planned to take NBC programming.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="6"/></line><line>&quot;I can't give you the secrets to the nuclear code,&quot;

he says, &quot;everybody, including Mr. De Niro, broke up, and that was sort of an icebreaker.&quot;</line><line>No icebreaker was required with Russo, who Alexander says reminded him of his first days with &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus.</line><line>&quot;Usually there's a learning curve when you work with somebody for the first time,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;But with Julia, she came in the door and said, 'Let's do it.'</line><line>It was the same with Rene - when I met her, she said, 'I think you're really funny, so show me how to be.'</line><line>&quot;We had a lot of fun, which was fortunate, because we're sort of joined at the hip during the entire film.&quot;</line><line>Alexander has 4- and 8-year-old sons, but he says they didn't influence his decision to accept &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle.&quot;</line><line>In fact, he doubts they'll even see it.</line><line>&quot;My children are so unimpressed with me that it's pathetic,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;I can't get them to watch anything I'm in.</line><line>They never saw 'Seinfeld,' and they won't even watch 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' where I did the gargoyle voice.</line><line>&quot;I think my children hate me,&quot; he concludes.</line><line>&quot;I may go into therapy about it.&quot;</line><line>His own childhood, spent in a middle-class New Jersey suburb, was no picnic, Alexander says.</line><line>&quot;I wished I could have been invisible,&quot; he says, suddenly serious.</line><line>&quot;I was very heavy, and I got picked on a lot.</line><line>I spent my early school years trying to disappear.</line><line>&quot;Then I discovered a pre-emptive strike - getting kids to laugh with me instead of at me,&quot; he recalls.</line><line>&quot;I had dozens of comedy albums, and I just memorized the material from all these comedians and tried to do it exactly like they did.</line><line>I would imitate their voices, their timing, everything.</line><line>&quot;It seemed to work,&quot; Alexander says.</line><line>&quot;Suddenly I wasn't getting picked on anymore.</line><line>But I was not the class clown, and I never thought of being an actor - I was just trying to survive.&quot;</line><line>By the time he was a teen-ager, however, he had begun singing and dancing lessons, which paid off when he headed for Broadway.</line><line>In 1989 he earned a Tony Award for his performance in &quot;Jerome Robbins' Broadway.&quot;</line><line>In fact, he says, if it weren't for Nathan Lane he might still be on Broadway, since Lane often snagged roles Alexander was after, and vice versa.</line><line>&quot;I'd see him at an audition and say, 'Maybe we should just flip a coin to decide which one of us should leave,'&quot; the actor recalls.</line><line>&quot;I'd be up to replace him and he'd be up to replace me.</line><line>The sad part is that Nathan and I never ended up doing anything together.&quot;</line><line>As it turned out, true stardom awaited Alexander on television, in the form of the bumbling, self-obsessed George Costanza.</line><line>&quot;I'm always kind of stunned by the love people have for George,&quot; he says, shrugging.</line><line>&quot;I get letters from people going, 'You know, my friends tell me I'm just like George.'</line><line>&quot;I'd say, 'You either need therapy or different friends - that is not a compliment.'&quot;</line><line>Alexander settles back reflectively.</line><line>&quot;I guess what was charming about George, if that's the right word, is that he was an everyman who went through an everyman's problems with the world,&quot; he muses.</line><line>&quot;He reacted with anger and self-aggrandizement but, to his credit, he also was self-deprecating.</line><line>It's why people love Howard Stern - he's vicious and inappropriate, but he skewers himself more mercilessly than anybody else.&quot;</line><line>Alexander may be a star, but he's avoided most of the Hollywood lifestyle, and has been married to Daena Title for 18 years.</line><line>&quot;It's dumb luck,&quot; Alexander says with a smile.</line><line>&quot;But when you get toward middle age, you hit a bump.</line><line>Daena and I have had some problems, and a couple of years ago we went into therapy and worked on them.</line><line>&quot;It's not easy,&quot; he concedes.</line><line>&quot;It's not fun.</line><line>But if you have something valuable, you do it.</line><line>We came out at a better place than when we started our relationship.</line><line>I'm very lucky, because I'm married to an exceptional woman.&quot;</line><line>Raising their children has been made much more complicated by Alexander's success on &quot;Seinfeld.&quot;</line><line>&quot;Fortunately and unfortunately, you can't escape the fact of celebrity,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;There are perks and there are problems.</line><line>For instance, we want our kids to have a normal life - but I can't take them to the supermarket, because I'll get too much attention.</line><line>So we have an assistant go to the market and, if they want to go, they go with the assistant.</line><line>That's not normal, so it's kind of a vicious cycle.&quot;</line><line>&quot;Seinfeld&quot; made its cast members rich, with Alexander, Louis-Dreyfus and co-star Michael Richards pocketing $600,000 per episode for the final season.</line><line>Alexander admits to mixed feelings about the whole thing.</line><line>&quot;Am I worth almost a million dollars?&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;I remember something Jerry Seinfeld said, when they asked him if he really needed 42 Porsches: He said, 'Let's get something straight - I don't even need one.'</line><line>&quot;So I don't need a million dollars,&quot; Alexander concedes.</line><line>&quot;But in the TV marketplace we were running circles around everybody else, so why not?</line><line>&quot;But the world is bent on its ear in that respect - nothing I do is worth what a schoolteacher does.&quot;

said Larry David, the co-creator and executive producer of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; for seven years.</line><line>&quot;But he vetoed this.&quot;</line><line>&quot;This&quot; is an incest-themed story line that never showed up on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; but that David was taping two weeks ago for his new show, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&quot; starting on HBO in October.</line><line>David, who plays himself, is asked by an old girlfriend to go with her to a support group for incest survivors.</line><line>He tries to worm out of it, arguing that abuse by a stepfather might not count.</line><line>&quot;With all due respect to your ordeal,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;There might be a whole other group for stepthings.&quot;</line><line>He goes to the meeting and makes up an incest event of his own.</line><line>Later, he will pay, both for agreeing to accompany his ex and for lying.</line><line>In David's world, no bad or good deed goes unpunished.</line><line>Seinfeld isn't sure he vetoed incest.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>&quot;I don't really remember that,&quot; he said.</line><line>But you can see why such a plot twist - or twisted plot - might have raised red flags at their old network, NBC.</line><line>On HBO, such sensitivities fall under the forgiving umbrella of creative license.</line><line>And the man who wrote and supervised the other writers of one of the most acclaimed and lucrative sitcoms of all time gets a lot of license.</line><line>Larry David is hardly a household name.</line><line>But few households do not know the intimate details of his life, his obsessions, his euphemistic catchphrases (&quot;master of my domain&quot;).</line><line>He, not Seinfeld, had the wacky neighbor named Kramer.</line><line>He once ruined a suede jacket worn for a scary meeting with a girlfriend's father.</line><line>He was the model for Jason Alexander's portrayal of Jerry's alter ego, George Costanza.</line><line>And yet, the only on-air exposure his millions of viewers ever got to David was his uncanny vocal impersonation of George Steinbrenner.</line><line>HBO subscribers got a glimpse of him, though, in an hourlong mock documentary, also called &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&quot; which the channel has shown every so often since last October.</line><line>In it, a camera crew purports to follow David, who is 52, around as he works the comedy club circuit in preparation for a supposed HBO stand-up special.</line><line>It ends with Larry chickening out of the special.</line><line>Other characters include his wife and his manager, who happen to hate each other, various alleged HBO executives and cameos by minor celebrities.</line><line>&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; was directed by Robert Weide, a documentary filmmaker whose specialty is comedians (most recently Lenny Bruce).</line><line>The whole thing was a put-on, but seemed so real that a friend of the actress playing David's wife was offended that she wasn't invited to their wedding.</line><line>Imagine &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; - only more so.</line><line>Coincidentally in sync with &quot;Survivor&quot; and the current mania for voyeuristic programming, David has created a hybrid of extreme reality and extreme comedy.</line><line>All dialogue is improvised from a loose five-page outline that he has written for each of the 10 episodes of the series.</line><line>The stand-up scenes and mock-documentary gimmick have been dropped.</line><line>But it still has the same verite feel.</line><line>It's deadpan in a way that will certainly appeal to critics if not a mass audience expecting the second coming of &quot;Seinfeld.&quot;</line><line>In some ways &quot;Curb&quot; is subtler and more nuanced, but with the same unmistakably Seinfeldian structure of snowballing bad luck.</line><line>David's desert island may be Los Angeles, but that doesn't make survival any easier.</line><line>&quot;This show is about a guy trying to get through the day with a little dignity attached,&quot; said Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming.</line><line>Albrecht has known David since the 1970s, when they were both unsuccessful comics at Catch a Rising Star here.</line><line>&quot;Larry's an incredible everyman,&quot; he said.</line><line>An everyman reported by Forbes magazine to have hit a $242 million jackpot when &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was sold into syndication.</line><line>But unlike Seinfeld, who collects Porches like baseball cards, David has never really been able to enjoy his windfall.</line><line>&quot;Mostly what it does is make you apologize a lot,&quot; he said.</line><line>Unlike the dwarfish, irritable Costanza, David is a rangy character with a quick smile.</line><line>He has a penchant for wide-wale cords and untucked shirts.</line><line>To look at him, you wouldn't know he was loaded, but out here, you never can tell.</line><line>By the pool of the once-glamorous Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, he ate his lunch during a break in the incest group scene and subjected himself to questions about the real Larry David.</line><line>&quot;I have quite a house,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;People come over and I go, 'I know, I'm sorry.'&quot;</line><line>Albrecht said David's world view could be summarized as, &quot;I know, I should have had the chicken.&quot;</line><line>Regret, remorse - those are old friends of his comedy.</line><line>Long ago, he taught himself never to think about the future because it was too painful for him to contemplate.</line><line>&quot;To regret the past - yes!&quot; he said, his voice rising to a characteristically Costanzan shout.</line><line>&quot;To regret everything about the past - certainly!&quot;</line><line>The present is no picnic either, what with its habit of turning into the regrettable past.</line><line>In one episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&quot; in a car-phone conversation with his manager, he refers to his wife as &quot;Hitler.&quot;</line><line>(Verbalizing things that the rest of us might think but would never say is a David specialty.)</line><line>The manager is in his own car, on his speakerphone, but fails to mention that his parents are in the back seat.</line><line>So offended are they by the Hitler remark that David is later called upon to offer an apology.</line><line>(Another speciality is awkward moments.)</line><line>&quot;People are constantly screaming at me on the show,&quot; he said, allowing that this is a slight exaggeration of his relatively civilized existence as a supersuccessful Los Angelino.</line><line>&quot;When I was living in New York, there was a lot of screaming in my life.</line><line>I would just get into these altercations all the time.</line><line>Being in public, dealing with shopkeepers, just trying to cross the street - things like that.</line><line>I'm not in a position where I can scream like that anymore.</line><line>I'm not quite as anonymous as I was.</line><line>And I guess things aren't as vital to me as they were then.&quot;</line><line>It was during those struggling stand-up days in New York when David and Seinfeld became friends.</line><line>They'd meet at coffee shops and talk for hours about things like laundry.</line><line>As Seinfeld recalled, &quot;What we had in common was both of us had the ability to focus deeply on something small, to blow small things out of proportion.&quot;</line><line>One of them was on his way to becoming one of the most successful comedians in the country.</line><line>The other remained a comic's comic, meaning he'd perform in front of five people and they'd boo him off the stage.</line><line>Interviewed in the &quot;Curb&quot; special, Seinfeld said David would address the audience as &quot;You people,&quot; which, as Seinfeld would tell him, &quot;was a little distancing.&quot;</line><line>The highlight of David's pre-&quot;Seinfeld&quot; career was a stint writing and performing on &quot;Fridays,&quot; ABC's short-lived &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; clone.</line><line>Also in the &quot;Fridays&quot; cast was Michael Richards, later to play the fictional version of David's old neighbor Kramer.</line><line>The conventional wisdom on why the Seinfeld-David collaboration worked so well is that Jerry made Larry palatable to a mass audience.</line><line>They both hate the inevitable Lennon-McCartney analogy.</line><line>&quot;Whether it was a dark thing or a light thing,&quot; Seinfeld said, &quot;we almost always agreed on what was funny and what wasn't funny.&quot;</line><line>The major point of contention was that, almost as soon as they started doing the show together, David wanted to stop.</line><line>He had no more ideas.</line><line>He constantly worried about keeping it funny.</line><line>It was too stressful, he'd complain.</line><line>After the show had been on for a few years, executives from Castle Rock, the production company, told its creators that they were in a position to make some serious money on the show.</line><line>Weide recalled David's reaction to this news: &quot;Larry said, 'Great!</line><line>Now we can take it off the air.'&quot;</line><line>He finally left in 1996, returning only to write the series finale in 1998.</line><line>David's first outing without Seinfeld was not auspicious.</line><line>&quot;Sour Grapes,&quot; the 1998 movie he wrote and directed, was a black-humored morality tale of two cousins who fall out over money: One lends the other the quarters he uses to win a slot machine jackpot in Atlantic City.</line><line>Roger Ebert called it &quot;a comedy about things that aren't funny&quot; and didn't stop there.</line><line>&quot;I can't easily remember a film I've enjoyed less,&quot; he said.</line><line>Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, was kinder: &quot;'Sour Grapes' should soften the blow of 'Seinfeld's' imminent extinction with the good news that, in David's merry world of hair splitting and back stabbing, the dream definitely lives on.&quot;</line><line>Moviegoers did not agree.</line><line>Expectations could not have been higher, except maybe for the final episode of &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; which also received less-than-glowing reviews.</line><line>&quot;Let them try to write it!&quot;</line><line>David said on the set last week.</line><line>&quot;I shouldn't have kept the script a secret.&quot;</line><line>Wincing with remorse, he still feels burned by the overhype that surrounded that show.</line><line>No danger of that happening this time around.</line><line>David is determined to undersell himself, even in the title.</line><line>HBO wanted to give him a billboard on Sunset Boulevard.</line><line>No way.</line><line>&quot;I don't want to do anything,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;I can't stand reading anything that I've said.</line><line>I hate that kind of attention.</line><line>I don't want articles and pictures.&quot;</line><line>His action plan: &quot;Let the show sneak up on people.&quot;</line><line>In his vampiric fear of the limelight, David is more like a writer than a performer.</line><line>But he is remarkably relaxed in front of the camera, quite at ease playing himself.</line><line>Much of the comedy of the series is simply his poker-faced reactions to the terrible situations he has wrought.</line><line>And the improvisational style of the show, having to be funny on his feet, leaves him less time to worry about his acting, or how he looks.</line><line>Over lunch, he wondered if he was the first bald star of a sitcom since Phil Silvers, whose show he loved, growing up in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.</line><line>&quot;I was thinking about it, but I couldn't come up with any.</line><line>I guess, Don Rickles.&quot;</line><line>Jeff Garlin, who plays Larry's manager, said David's point of view is defined by three things: &quot;Anxiety, anger and despair.&quot;</line><line>Despite which he manages to be an extremely friendly, likable and funny guy to be around.</line><line>Here at the Roosevelt Hotel, attended to by a personal assistant who looks like Liv Tyler, possibly better, and no network suits in sight, he seemed ... happy.</line><line>&quot;He's having as good a time as I've ever known Larry to have,&quot; Weide said.</line><line>This miserable fictional Larry is not quite him, after all.</line><line>His wife and manager don't actually hate each other.</line><line>Really, they don't.</line></document><document name="NYT20000724.0361"><line>Actor Michael Richards is reed thin.</line><line>Actor John Goodman is not.</line><line>But the two have something very much in common: Each has a new sitcom on the fall schedule, and neither had much to bring to show-and-tell at the TV critics' press tour in Pasadena.</line><line>After shooting pilot episodes, each has scrapped the first draft and gone back to the drawing board.</line><line>Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in &quot;The Michael Richards Show&quot;

said Richards.</line><line>&quot;And he had a few line suggestions, and then said, 'Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off.&quot;</line><line>Because Richards will be an executive producer as well as the star of the series, he also tapped Seinfeld's knowledge of the &quot;logistics&quot; of the former role.</line><line>The biggest logistical challenge may be in getting viewers to accept Richards in a non-Kramer role.</line><line>Co-creator Gregg Kavet touched on the conundrum the &quot;Michael Richards&quot;
