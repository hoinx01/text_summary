he said.</line><line>So far, in addition to the thousands killed and injured, the quake did extensive damage to residential and industrial buildings in Izmit and nearby towns in a major industrial center, and left more than 100,000 homeless.</line><line>The damage is expected to run to billions of dollars.</line><line>For the last decade, the MIT-Turkish team has been monitoring the motion of the ground along both sides of the fault line using one of the world's most advanced networks of GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite receivers, which can pinpoint locations to within one-tenth of an inch.</line><line>It was readings from these instruments that showed that &quot;this was the region where most of the stresses were accumulating,&quot; Toksoz said.</line><line>But these GPS readings have only been taken once a year; a new system, using GPS receivers that continuously send position information, is being installed to replace the decade-old stations.</line><line>But only one station is operational.</line><line>If a network of the new monitors had been in place, Toksoz said, &quot;we might have been able to predict the quake and provide some warning.&quot;</line><line>That warning might have been anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before the shaking began, he said, providing enough time for people to leave vulnerable buildings, and perhaps even to store water and supplies.</line><line>A real-time warning based on GPS data has never been issued, Toksoz said.</line><line>But the only similar networks of monitoring stations in the world, one in Japan and one in southern California, have shown distinct signs of some impending earthquakes when scientists have looked back at the records after a quake occurred.</line><line>&quot;People have detected precursor motions,&quot; Toksoz said, &quot;but not in real time.&quot;</line><line>With the added impetus of this quake, he said, &quot;we'll push on with it.&quot;</line><line>He said earthquakes have been gradually migrating westward along the North Anatolian fault, as stress builds up in the rock and is then released.</line><line>The largest earthquake ever recorded on the fault was a magnitude 8.2 quake in 1939, which killed 20,000 people, and there have been six other quakes greater than magnitude 7 since then, each spanning a 60- to 100-mile segment of the fault.</line><line>Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, with a population of 12 million, lies just 65 miles west of Izmit, and may be the next place to feel the fault's wrath.</line><line>The fault line, which closely resembles California's San Andreas fault, passes just a few miles from the city.</line><line>Geologists call both faults right-handed strike-slip faults.</line><line>The Izmit earthquake may actually have increased the stresses on the Istanbul segment of the fault, increasing the odds of a major quake there in coming years.</line><line>&quot;We're very much concerned about what might happen in that area,&quot; Toksoz said.</line><line>&quot;There is the potential for a major earthquake.&quot;</line><line>There is an earthquake building code in place in the city, he said, &quot;but unfortunately, implementation is lax.&quot;</line><line>As a result, he said, a major quake striking the city &quot;could be an economic disaster as well as a human disaster.&quot;</line><line>Even this week's quake, though centered 65 miles away, did some property damage and caused a few deaths in Istanbul.</line><line>&quot;But with warning, we could at least prevent some of the human casualties.&quot;</line><line>This quake's magnitude, still being worked out by scientists in Turkey, the United States and other countries, has been identified as magnitude 7.5 by the MIT scientists, 6.8 by Turkish scientists, and 7.8 by the US Geological Survey.</line><line>Bill Smith, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, explained that such numbers are &quot;still subject to change.</line><line>Some of these magnitude calculations are very labor intensive. ...</line><line>Magnitude is not a precise measurement, it's really an art.&quot;</line><line>Smith said scientists use six to eight different magnitude numbers, computed using the various waves produced by a quake.</line><line>But, he said, &quot;In most cases, the numbers agree better than on this one.&quot;</line><line>It is not yet clear what this unusual disparity might mean, he said.</line><line>Toksoz added that readings based on measurements farther from the site usually give a more accurate representation, because instruments close to the quake can be &quot;saturated&quot; by the intensity of the shaking and get a lower reading.</line><line>Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded since the main quake, which occurred at about 3 a.m. local time.</line><line>The largest of the aftershocks was magnitude 5.3, just over three hours later, but activity is continuing and will be closely monitored.</line><line>The quake was the largest recorded in Turkey since 1976.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="29"><scu uid="63" label="Turkey's 1,300 Aftershocks were the largest since 1976" weight="1"/></annotation></line></document><document name="NYT19990818.0302"><line>More than 1,000 relief workers from 19 countries joined the frantic search Wednesday for victims of Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government regulations.<annotation scu-count="2" sum-count="1" sums="2"><scu uid="3" label="Nineteen countries sent over 1,000 rescuers to Turkey" weight="2"/><scu uid="102" label="Lax building codes contributed to the destruction by allowing substandard buildings" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>Although rescue workers continued to find people alive under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbed steadily: By Wednesday night, according to an official count, 3,879 bodies had been recovered.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="23"/></line><line>More than 16,000 people were listed as seriously injured.</line><line>Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that the death toll could rise further.</line><line>He said rescue teams had been unable to reach some areas because roads are impassable and communications disrupted.</line><line>Parliament met in special session, and members listened gravely as the minister of Public Works and Housing, Koray Aydin, described the extent of the calamity.</line><line>&quot;We are facing the greatest natural disaster in the history of the Turkish Republic,&quot;
