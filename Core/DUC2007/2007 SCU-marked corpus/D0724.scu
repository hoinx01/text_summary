fat genes as a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of famine,&quot; Ravussin said.</line><line>As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods of cholla-cactus buds, honey mesquite, prickly pears and tepary beans, squash and white-winged dove, their weight was kept in check during normal times.</line><line>But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to eat like other Americans, and in mass quantities like other Americans, their thrifty fat genes became a liability.</line><line>Their new higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized, according to Ravussin.</line><line>Geneticist Murray Brilliant, a professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said it's not exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima population.</line><line>&quot;But, obviously, in every population there are people who have more thrifty genes than other people,&quot; Brilliant said.</line><line>&quot;If that wasn't the case, then everybody who ate the same thing would be the same weight.&quot;</line><line>There's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to hormonal irregularities.</line><line>Obesity specialist Dr. Donald Robertson of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale, Ariz., said the consensus among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine organ.</line><line>&quot;Like a thyroid or adrenal, it produces its own hormone, called leptin,&quot; Robertson said.</line><line>&quot;Understanding how leptin works seems to be a key in treating obesity.&quot;</line><line>It's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop eating, which creates the sensation of satiation, or feeling full.</line><line>However, this signal does not get through properly in some overweight people.</line><line>Consequently, scientists have tried to inject synthetic leptin, hoping this would stimulate the satiation response.</line><line>But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be.</line><line>Endocrinologist Dr. Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas and obesity.</line><line>His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that obesity has a physiological basis.</line><line>&quot;I don't think there's any question that obesity is a disease,&quot; Tataranni said.</line><line>&quot;It's a matter of understanding how hormones stimulate different areas of the brain.&quot;</line><line>On occasion, obesity research has turned up the unexpected.</line><line>A London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological behavior.</line><line>People who are overweight often say they don't understand their weight gain because they &quot;practically eat nothing at all.&quot;</line><line>Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically underestimate their food intake (up to 50 percent), especially the high caloric, fatty foods.</line><line>&quot;We don't know if it's lying or a subconscious omission,&quot; said head researcher Dr. Berit Heitmann.</line><line>In either case, researchers in the study concluded that denial further impedes chances for weight loss.</line><line>It's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate factors have in the overall obesity package.</line><line>But Harrowe, the Pima public health officer, feels emphasizing factors we can't control does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight.</line><line>&quot;What you don't want is people developing this attitude that there's nothing they can do about it anyway,&quot; Harrowe said.</line><line>&quot;You have to focus on lifestyle changes.&quot;</line><line>Many obesity researchers agree, and believe that the fat epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that places inordinate emphasis on quantity.</line><line>&quot;Becoming obese is a normal response to the American environment,&quot; said obesity researcher Hill.</line><line>Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food available; social and work situations encourage overeating; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings; 64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise.</line><line>Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health, agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the pathoenvironment.</line><line>&quot;Obviously, if the Pimas' environment had not changed so drastically, they would not be in their current condition,&quot; Ravussin said.</line><line>&quot;But the same can be said for non-Pimas.</line><line>Getting food was hard work until 100 years ago.</line><line>Now, it's available in abundance without any activity required to obtain it.&quot;</line><line>Robertson, of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center, said he'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the largest soft drink under a buck.</line><line>He said he'd also like restaurants to be more responsible in the portions they serve.</line><line>&quot;You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a normal meal and you get enough for three people,&quot; Robertson said.</line><line>&quot;It's obscene.</line><line>My wife and I now routinely order one entree and split it.&quot;</line><line>If nothing else, obesity specialists want the public to snap out of it and wake up to the serious health risks associated with being overweight.</line><line>Science, they remind us, has yet to find a magic pill that cuts weight gain without unhealthful side effects, and many researchers believe that any such drug will have to be combined with diet and exercise anyway.</line><line>Thomas Ropp can be reached at thomas.ropp(at)pni.com via e-mail.</line><line>Are you obese?</line><line>Obesity is defined clinically as being 20 percent heavier than your ideal weight.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="24"><scu uid="74" label="Obesity is defined as being 20% heavier than your ideal weight" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>Overwhelming research shows that the risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, osteoarthritis and even some forms of cancer start to climb when body-fat levels are above a rating of 24 BMI (body mass index), but really soar above a BMI of 30.</line><line>A rating of 25 is overweight;

said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, head of molecular genetics at Columbia University and a co-director of the diabetes center.</line><line>Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2 diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care physicians.</line><line>Until the last few years, Goland said, the correct diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children.</line><line>Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar.</line><line>Most children with the disease have a form called Type 1, or juvenile diabetes, which develops when the pancreas, for no known reason, stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose use.</line><line>These children must take daily insulin injections for the rest of their lives or face almost immediate death, while also limiting their sugar intake.</line><line>In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it.</line><line>Many people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the disease because it can occur in the body for years without symptoms.</line><line>If the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, however, life-threatening complications, caused by damage to blood vessels, can develop within 10 years to 20 years.</line><line>&quot;If we aren't detecting this disease in children because we aren't looking for it,&quot; Goland said, &quot;then we are going to start seeing complications in people in their 20s that we would normally associate with people in their 60s and 70s.&quot;</line><line>At 38, Valeria Wilson of the Bronx has already had two heart attacks - complications from Type 2 diabetes.</line><line>The diabetes has also caused such poor vision that she stopped working two years ago and hired a nurse to measure her insulin doses.</line><line>Ms. Wilson, 5 feet, 6 inches and 251 pounds, was told she had Type 2 during a routine pregnancy exam when she was 21, but doctors suspect she probably had the disease for years.</line><line>The delayed diagnosis, doctors said, likely contributed to her health problems.</line><line>&quot;I got old too fast,&quot; said Ms. Wilson, the mother of two daughters.</line><line>&quot;My mother is 73, and she's not as sick as me.&quot;</line><line>Like adults with Type 2, many children with the disease can control their blood glucose levels with weight loss and diet modification.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="24"/></line><line>Eventually, however, most people require oral medication and insulin.</line><line>&quot;These are children who likely would have developed the disease at some later time in their lives, but their obesity has brought it out early,&quot; said Dr. Sandra Puczynski, chairwoman of the research advisory board for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.</line><line>&quot;Losing weight will not cure them, but it would help significantly.&quot;</line><line>Losing weight is a daunting goal for many children with Type 2 diabetes.</line><line>Often they have parents who work long hours and cannot be home to prepare balanced meals, and they live in neighborhoods where fast food restaurants and convenience stores outnumber supermarkets.</line><line>Within a block of 12-year-old Nuribel Reyes' home in Queens, there is a McDonald's and a Burger King.</line><line>&quot;She used to eat at McDonald's every night,&quot; said her mother, Amancia Reyes, who runs two small beauty salons.</line><line>By the time she was 10, Nuribel, at 4 feet, 6 inches, weighed more than 145 pounds.</line><line>Mrs. Reyes said that when her daughter first began gaining weight, the doctors told her the girl would outgrow the &quot;baby-fat&quot; after she passed puberty.</line><line>That summer, Nuribel developed a severe yeast infection and began losing bladder control - common symptoms of adult-onset diabetes - and the disease was diagnosed by a different doctor.</line><line>By adhering to a strict meal plan, Nuribel maintained the same weight as she grew taller, and her blood glucose levels fell to normal range.</line><line>But this year, Nuribel started at a new school.</line><line>Her mother said her determination to lose weight has deteriorated, and with it, her health.</line><line>Embarrassed, Nuribel has not told classmates or teachers about her disease.</line><line>She refuses to take a lunch to school, and sometimes, Nuribel said, when her friends buy candy bars, so does she.</line><line>&quot;The sugar in her blood is getting high again,&quot; Mrs. Reyes said, crying.</line><line>&quot;I worry all the time that one day she is going to be at school and eat something that will damage one of her organs.&quot;</line><line>Several small studies in cities across the country - including Cincinnati and San Antonio - provided the first data about the rise in cases like Nuribel's.</line><line>A 1996 study, conducted at a Cincinnati diabetes center by the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, showed that among their pediatric patients, 16 percent had Type 2 in 1994, compared to 2 percent to 4 percent prior to 1992.</line><line>The researchers also found that Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in more than one-third of new diabetes patients between the ages of 10 and 19.</line><line>And Dr. Kenneth Jones, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California at San Diego, said clinics in his area report that the number of children with Type 2 diabetes has increased tenfold in the last five years.</line><line>&quot;We used to maybe see one case a year,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;Now we see one case a month, and some clinics are reporting two and three cases a month.</line><line>It's pretty scary.&quot;</line><line>Identifying children who are at risk is relatively easy.</line><line>In addition to obesity and a family history of the disease, researchers said, many develop a condition called acanthosis nigricans, dark, irregular folds of skin around the neck, under the arms or behind the knees.</line><line>Symptoms of the disease include frequent urination and chronic thirst.</line><line>Nigel Estick, a 17-year-old senior at La Guardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan, suffered these symptoms for years before the disease was diagnosed.</line><line>He had pains in his legs, a frequently dry mouth and deteriorating vision.</line><line>But, his mother said, doctors told her there was nothing seriously wrong with him.</line><line>They suggested that he was emotionally depressed, put him on Prozac, and urged her to insist that he stay in school.</line><line>&quot;They tested him for leukemia, they tested him for sickle cell,&quot; his mother, Patricia Estick, grumbled, &quot;but no one tested him for diabetes.&quot;</line><line>Then, Nigel, who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 250 pounds, began vomiting two or three times a day.</line><line>One morning, he could hardly stand and his vision was completely blurred.</line><line>Emergency room doctors discovered that Nigel's blood glucose level had soared to 8 times higher than normal.</line><line>He spent nearly a week in intensive care.</line><line>Today, Nigel is 40 pounds lighter.</line><line>He takes two insulin shots a day and tries to stay away from the Snickers bars he adores.</line><line>Pleased with his progress, doctors said they hope to get the teen-ager off insulin soon.</line><line>At times, Nigel said, he cannot enjoy his improvement because of worries about what lies ahead.</line><line>&quot;This disease is probably going to really mess me up,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;Eventually everyone succumbs to the disease.&quot;</line><line>Adults with Type 2 diabetes often control the disease with oral medications and sometimes the same pills are used in children, however none of the drugs have been formally approved for pediatric patients.</line><line>In the next month, several clinics across the country will begin testing the drug metformin in children with Type 2.</line><line>In Manhattan, trials will be conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center and at the Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia's medical school.</line><line>Opened in October, the Berrie center is different from many other diabetes treatment centers in that doctors and nutritionists actively encourage a diabetic's family and friends to become educated about the disease and to help the patients stay healthy.</line><line>Nutritionists travel to schools to speak to patients' teachers and classmates, teammates and cafeteria staff.</line><line>They make house calls to examine foods in their patients' homes and to lead family discussions about the importance of exercise and healthy eating.</line><line>And they conduct regular supermarket tours, like the recent Friday afternoon trip with Tyshon.</line><line>&quot;If we can get family and friends involved with the treatment, we will be much more successful in getting kids to be compliant,&quot; Goland said.</line><line>In addition to his nutritional and family counseling, doctors at the Naomi Berrie center have begun treating Tyshon with metformin.</line><line>At his last checkup, he had lost 25 pounds.</line><line>Tyshon, his mother and his nutritionist, Kira Almeida, were thrilled.</line><line>&quot;Nothing is off limits to you,&quot; she said, urging Tyshon to stick with his new eating habits.</line><line>&quot;But you have to eat in moderation.</line><line>Small changes can make a big difference.&quot;</line></document><document name="NYT19990315.0227"><line>An assortment of mice with mutant genes may be leading researchers toward the elusive goal of obesity treatments that are safe, effective and don't call for the will power of a Spartan.</line><line>In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their poundage down while still filling up with food they like.</line><line>With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust, many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from work going on at a frantic pace - and amid much secrecy - in biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the body's weight control system.</line><line>While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment - like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods - the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures.<annotation scu-count="4" sum-count="2" sums="23,9"><scu uid="49" label="Genetic factors only partially impact obesity rates" weight="4"/><scu uid="72" label="Abundance of food contributes to obesity." weight="4"/><scu uid="69" label="Scientists are researching the genetic causes of obesity." weight="1"/><scu uid="83" label="Obesity is caused by a combination of factors" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>&quot;I don't believe that social engineering (behavior change) is going to work&quot;

therapies are a long way off, but the investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.</line><line>&quot;It is quite a race,&quot; says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily invested in obesity gene research.</line><line>Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.</line><line>The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much fat the body stores.</line><line>The discovery brings to over a dozen the number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.</line><line>It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects the mice against diet-induced obesity.</line><line>But researchers are confident they will in time be able to trace the different biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be the important regulatory devices in this system.</line><line>&quot;Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug development,&quot; Dr. Karen Moore, Millennium's director of genetic systems said when making the announcement last week.</line><line>&quot;In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it,</line><line>The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="29"><scu uid="69" label="Scientists are researching the genetic causes of obesity." weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>Not only does it suggest that similar genes in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.</line><line>Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that simple to pick apart the human weight control system.</line><line>&quot;The majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would explain their obesity,&quot; says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.</line><line>More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in combination with environmental factors.</line><line>The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's health - some 55 percent, or 97 million - of Americans are overweight and obese - but also gathering profits for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.</line><line>This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to be obese.</line><line>The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food intake by signaling the brain to create a &quot;full&quot; feeling in th person.</line><line>Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their brains fail to signal them to stop eating.</line><line>So, the reasoning went, give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and cause them to lose weight.</line><line>A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen, Inc., in California, was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical trials.</line><line>Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although the compound has worked for some of the volunteers.</line><line>Moreover, it's been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin: it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting to the right receiving station.</line><line>Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight and energy balance.</line><line>Each of these gene alterations provide clues to how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so far.</line><line>Still, the discovery of the ob gene was &quot;a real breakthrough, because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,&quot; says Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California in Davis.</line><line>How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the market is anybody's guess.</line><line>&quot;We don't know the final chapter - we're just learning about the puzzle&quot; of weight regulation, says Stern.</line><line>However, she says, &quot;we can't wait until we identify all the genes - we have to do something now&quot; about the obesity epidemic.</line><line>Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make obesity a high priority for research and public policy.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="30,9"/></line><line>Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, &quot;it's giving the disease of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of compassion&quot;
