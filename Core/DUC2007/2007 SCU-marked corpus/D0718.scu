Vroom said.</line><line>&quot;That's a powerful thing.&quot;</line><line>Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods - not simply rental items, but, more important, goods deemed unsatisfactory by the customers.</line><line>Internet merchants have been widely criticized for their failures in this regard, particularly as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent - a rate slightly higher than in the catalog industry.</line><line>Retailers with stores online and offline, like Gap and Federated's Macy's, have had an edge at least in part because their customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought online or off.</line><line>And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up stores for this reason alone, they are clearly in the market for help from companies that can help streamline returns.</line><line>&quot;As I speak, there are four or five people from e-commerce companies in this building talking to us about it,&quot; said James Amos, chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc., speaking from his office in San Diego.</line><line>Amos estimated that 300 other companies had asked Mail Boxes &quot;for access to our 4,000 stores&quot; in the last several months.</line><line>&quot;We're in discussions with just about everyone that'd come to the top of your mind,&quot; he said.</line><line>Amos said the deluge began late last year when the company agreed to provide customers of eBay auctions with help in inspecting and returning items bought online.</line><line>Since then, Mail Boxes has begun installing satellite dishes in franchise stores, in hopes of connecting all of its business partners in a single network.</line><line>The satellites will not only provide high-speed Internet access, the company said, but will link the stores' cash registers directly to the corporate office and to the company's e-commerce partners.</line><line>That setup, in turn, will allow the company to plug into the back-office systems of Internet retailers - so that if a customer of an Internet-only merchant wanted to exchange an item at a Mail Boxes store, the replacement item could be sent to a Mail Boxes location.</line><line>The customer could then simply drop off the old item, pick up the new one and not have to deal with packaging, postage or coordinating delivery times.</line><line>Noting that the first e-commerce partnerships will be announced after the satellite system is completed next month, Amos said, &quot;We're basically going to be a bridge between the virtual and the real world.&quot;</line><line>Naturally, Mail Boxes will have plenty of company in that regard.</line><line>United Parcel Service, which recently announced plans to expand its network of drop-off centers by testing storefront locations in suburban areas, might use those stores to support e-commerce companies.</line><line>&quot;We're definitely going to contemplate it,&quot; said Mark Rhoney, president of UPS eVentures, the business UPS set up to help e-commerce companies fill orders.</line><line>Kenny Kurtzman, chief executive of Ashford.com, an online jewelry and luxury goods retailer, would welcome a partnership with an offline company &quot;if that would help give customers an easier way to return products,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;We'd look to partner with someone like FedEx or UPS to do that.&quot;</line><line>In exploring its own partnerships with e-commerce companies, 7-Eleven has not been approached by online jewelers, &quot;but we have had some bizarre offers,&quot; said James Keyes, chief operating officer.</line><line>&quot;I don't think someone will pick up their living room furniture at our store.&quot;</line><line>Keyes said that by this summer, 7-Eleven would test ATMs with Internet access.</line><line>Besides getting cash, customers would be able to cash checks or obtain money orders or get directions from Web sites, for instance.</line><line>Initially, the ATMs would not include Internet retailers, he said, but that might change eventually.</line><line>&quot;If you wanted a new videogame, you could preview it and order it at the store, then have it delivered to the store on the day of the release,&quot; Keyes said.</line><line>Just such a service is already available in Japan, he said, as the result of an agreement between 7-Eleven and Sony.</line><line>The company would also welcome the chance to take returned merchandise for Web retailers, &quot;as long as the goods make sense in our environment,&quot; Keyes said.</line></document><document name="NYT20000801.0400"><line>The New York Times Co. and Starbucks Coffee Co. said Tuesday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times' advertising promotion of Starbucks.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="7" sums="1,13,14,23,30,6,9"><scu uid="37" label="Starbucks sold New York Times in return for advertising promotion in newspaper" weight="4"/></annotation></line><line>Financial terms were not disclosed.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="1,6"/></line><line>The agreement calls for The Times to be sold at all American Starbucks stores.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="1"/></line><line>Some stores may also offer local newspapers and other national newspapers.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="1"/></line><line>The Times will use its advertising resources to promote the products and retail outlets of Starbucks, which is based in Seattle.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="1"/></line><line>There will also be a link between The New York Times' circulation Web site (www.homedelivery.nytimes.com) and the Starbucks Web site (www.starbucks.com).<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="1"/></line></document></collection>
