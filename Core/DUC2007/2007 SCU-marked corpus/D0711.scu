said Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.</line><line>The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon - though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of Internet software standards.</line><line>&quot;Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no business interruption for Microsoft,&quot; said Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</line><line>&quot;Microsoft does not have to pull products out of distribution.&quot;</line><line>But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does &quot;rein Microsoft in, and it clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the antitrust case.&quot;</line></document><document name="NYT19981120.0383"><line>After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade Commission told Microsoft Corp.</line><line>Friday to change permanently one of its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch its step in the Internet browser market.</line><line>But despite the reprimand, the Japanese antitrust agency also stated that Microsoft's business practices &quot;cannot be immediately found to have tended to impede fair competition&quot; in the market for browser software in Japan.</line><line>Microsoft focused on that finding Friday as evidence that a major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had not found an anticompetitive effect.</line><line>&quot;The finding in Japan is potentially quite interesting from an American standpoint because the Japanese investigators looked at the same kinds of things that are at issue in Washington,&quot; said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international affairs.</line><line>Microsoft also announced Friday that the South Korean Fair Trade Commission had informed the company two months ago that its investigation of Microsoft, begun in November 1997, was concluded and that no further review was expected.</line><line>There is no direct link between the several overseas investigations of Microsoft and the antitrust case being heard in Washington, where the Justice Department and 20 states have sued Microsoft.</line><line>Antitrust experts said that most countries still investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S. antitrust case.</line><line>Karel van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy, said recently that the European Commission was &quot;closely watching&quot;

that Microsoft uses the price it charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over competing software.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="3" sums="13,2,23"><scu uid="37" label="19-20 states launched a trial accusing Microsoft of illegal activities" weight="3"/></annotation></line><line>Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.</line><line>IBM was the last major PC maker to sign a Windows 95 license agreement with Microsoft and, Norris said in his deposition that IBM did pay significantly more for Windows 95 than did a major IBM rival in the PC business, the Compaq Computer Corp.</line><line>He also testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying $9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45 for Windows 95.</line><line>Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in software, IBM had shared in the development costs.</line><line>Compaq's price for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.</line><line>The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several dollars lower than IBM's price.</line><line>But that, he insisted, was mainly because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which included providing customer support for Windows and writing software to make printers and other hardware work well with Windows.</line></document><document name="NYT19990613.0086"><line>The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial.</line><line>His litany of accusations was lengthy and specific - threats and enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp. delivered at meeting after meeting.</line><line>His charges were fleshed out with the dates, places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.</line><line>Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first representative of a PC maker to testify for the government.</line><line>David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the Norris testimony put a &quot;vivid human face&quot; on what he called &quot;some of the most important evidence in the case.&quot;</line><line>Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.</line><line>Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the representative witness for PC makers.</line><line>Ever since IBM selected Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in 1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the PC business - not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="9"/></line><line>The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions.</line><line>For months, the Justice Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand - and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of Gateway Inc., who ultimately decided against it.</line><line>Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to &quot;reduce, drop or eliminate&quot; shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing operating system.</line><line>On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were rejected.</line><line>But the legal standard in such cases, established in a 1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be &quot;uniquely unequivocal&quot; - in the airline case, the evidence was a tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.</line><line>With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence.</line><line>The contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows.</line><line>No Microsoft contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must &quot;drop or eliminate&quot; OS/2.</line><line>But he insisted that the overall effect of the Microsoft terms would be to &quot;kill OS/2 in the markeplace.&quot;</line><line>Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for Microsoft to offer a distributor - as the IBM PC business was - incentives to aggressively distribute its product.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="24"/></line><line>If accepting those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 - made by another unit of IBM - that is mainly a business decision for IBM to make, they say.</line><line>IBM turned down the Microsoft proposal.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust experts say it was probably not a violation.</line><line>&quot;It will be very difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,&quot; said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.</line><line>The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.</line><line>He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.</line><line>When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.</line><line>&quot;The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then getting punished on the price of Windows,&quot; said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher price for Windows than its competitors.</line><line>The exception was the Compaq Computer Corp., which received a significantly lower price, Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing Windows 95 - a straightforward business rationale for different terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.</line><line>But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on Microsoft's statement.</line><line>The document, an internal memo, said IBM believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.</line><line>&quot;IBM,&quot; the May 1997 document stated, &quot;currently pays a higher royalty than our leading competitors.&quot;</line><line>Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.</line><line>To protect confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took that testimony in closed sessions.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="6"/></line><line>If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more legal ammunition to the government's case.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="6"/></line><line>&quot;To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the puzzle,&quot; Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.</line></document><document name="NYT19991105.0200"><line>Here are the milestones in Microsoft's antitrust dealings with the government:</line><line>1990:</line><line>May 30 -

essentially a contractual agreement between the federal prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was &quot;no reason to read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the contours of antitrust law.&quot;</line><line>At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software was &quot;unsettled&quot; and added that the 1998 ruling was &quot;just one, if prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty.&quot;</line><line>Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal with physical products like cars and tires.</line><line>If given a chance at a software tying case, Lessig added, &quot;it is my view that there is a significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current doctrine.&quot;</line><line>&quot;Both sides&quot; in the Microsoft case, he wrote, &quot;are too quick, however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly applies to software products.&quot;</line><line>Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software - that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a dominant company engages in what he calls &quot;strategic bundling.&quot;</line><line>&quot;The aim of any antitrust inquiry,&quot; he wrote, &quot;should be whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its interlinkage through contract or software.&quot;</line><line>Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate tying law.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="24"/></line><line>&quot;Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible rationale for finding there were two products and a tying violation,&quot;
