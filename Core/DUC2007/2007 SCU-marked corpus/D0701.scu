Jones said.</line><line>&quot;If you can bring it to closure, everyone can finish the healing process.&quot;</line><line>Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="24,29"/></line><line>In the Birmingham case, for example, documents show that J.

Stoner and Robert Shelton.</line><line>Stoner was convicted in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell with Chambliss.</line><line>Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a few suspects in these kinds of slayings, but the statute of limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as well as in all the other cases from that time.</line><line>Jones said that his office was looking into using a federal law with no statute of limitations concerning the transport of dynamite in the bombing.</line><line>He said there is also a possibility of using state murder charges, which have no statute of limitations, as was done in 1977 against Chambliss.</line><line>But murder was the charge in the successful conviction in 1994 in Jackson, Miss., of the former Klansman, Byron De La Beckwith, who shot to death Evers, the field secretary of the Mississippi National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,.</line><line>The conviction came after two prosecutions of Beckwith ended in mistrials in the 1960s.</line><line>The case inspired the film &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi.&quot;</line><line>&quot;The Medgar Evers case was a wedge in the dam,&quot; said Dees of the law center, which keeps track of hate crimes and first called attention to many of the unresolved killings with racial links.</line><line>&quot;It gave everyone a tremendous amount of hope.&quot;</line><line>That hope helped to stir the call for reopening the Birmingham case.</line><line>It also prompted the family of Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi to push for a trial in his 1966 killing.</line><line>In 1998, a former Klan leader, Sam Bowers, was convicted of the fire-bombing murder of Dahmer, the Hattiesburg NAACP president.</line><line>Inspired by those successes, other families have begun pushing in the past year for answers in some of the lesser-known, long-ago slayings linked to race.</line><line>&quot;The South is still in the process of a cleansing moment with these cases,&quot; said Myrlie Evers-Williams, 66, widow of Medgar Evers and chairwoman emeritus of the NAACP.</line><line>&quot;I'm so thankful that others who have suffered the same injustice as we did have moved forth.</line><line>To see that pebble dropped in the water and the ripples go out says something about justice in this country.</line><line>There is still hope.&quot;</line><line>Still, not everyone is happy that these cases are back in the public spotlight.</line><line>Many prosecutors said they had been asked over and over why they wanted to stir up trouble.</line><line>&quot;I'll hear it from white people on the golf course,&quot; said Bob Helfrich, 45, the assistant district attorney in Hattiesburg who prosecuted Bowers and plans to prosecute Charles Noble, another man charged in the Dahmer case, next spring.</line><line>&quot;They say, 'Haven't we spent enough money on this?'</line><line>I have blacks tell me not to mess with this, too.</line><line>It is costly.</line><line>But you can't put a price on justice.&quot;</line><line>In Birmingham, at a recent ceremony at the 16th Street Church commemorating the victims of the bombing, police officers stood guard outside.</line><line>The church's pastor, the Rev. Christopher Hamlin, said such vigilance is necessary because the church has continued to receive bomb threats, especially in the three years since the case was reopened.</line><line>Across the street from the church, on a recent sunny day, Ronald Roscoe, 47, a heating and air-conditioning technician, who is black, was spending his lunch break in Kelly Ingram Park, near the church's memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing.</line><line>A city gardener using a leaf blower reminded Roscoe of the images from three decades ago of police officers wielding fire hoses in the park to disperse civil rights protesters.</line><line>Referring to the reopening of the bombing case, Roscoe said: &quot;It's a waste of time.</line><line>I wish them luck, but after all this time I don't believe the guys who did the bombing are ever going to be convicted.&quot;</line><line>Nearby, Shane Buggay, 32, an orthopedic surgeon, who is white, disagreed.</line><line>&quot;If they can get them, then those men should pay,&quot; Buggay said.</line><line>&quot;Time has nothing to do with it.</line><line>They are still trying to convict Nazis for war crimes from World War II.</line><line>It is just like that.&quot;</line><line>But not all of the recently resurrected cases in the South have resulted in convictions.</line><line>In Belzoni, Miss., this summer one suspect was acquitted in the 1970 slaying of Rainey Pool, a one-armed sharecropper.</line><line>Another man, Joe Oliver Watson, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case this summer and is awaiting sentencing.</line><line>Three others are set to go on trial Wednesday on charges of murdering Pool.</line><line>In Montgomery, earlier this year, a grand jury failed to indict two suspects, both former Klansmen, in the 1957 slaying of Willie Edwards Jr., a black truck driver.</line><line>And officials in Philadelphia, Miss., despite urging from the families of the victims, are not saying publicly whether they are investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18 men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of three civil rights workers there in 1964.</line><line>Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges, including Bowers, but none has ever been tried by the state for the Philadelphia killings.</line><line>Baxley, the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the Birmingham bombing case in 1977, said some of the same problems he encountered 20 years ago still exist.</line><line>For instance, he said his main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss, by then a frail 74-year-old, was once capable of killing four children.</line><line>&quot;It worried me,&quot; Baxley said, &quot;that they would look at him and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody.</line><line>So we had to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or uncle.</line><line>They had to see the evil in this man.&quot;</line><line>Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging witnesses with failing memories, or key witnesses who have already died.</line><line>In some of the slayings, no case files exist and no transcripts from trials on federal charges exist, as they do in better-known cases like the Evers slaying, the killings of the Philadelphia, Miss., rights workers and the Birmingham church bombing.</line><line>Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan.</line><line>Two major witnesses, whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in the bombing, refused to testify.</line><line>These days, some of that fear persists, but it is far less potent.</line><line>In the Birmingham case this summer, the third of Cherry's five wives told reporters before her grand jury testimony that Cherry had admitted his involvement in the bombing and had bragged about it.</line><line>&quot;Not all people remain the same all through their lives,&quot; said Joseph Lewis, 47, head of the Birmingham division of the FBI, which has been investigating the case since 1996.</line><line>&quot;When they are getting close to their final days, they may say, 'Well, it's time to clear my conscience before I meet my maker.'</line><line>That's what you hope for in cases like this.&quot;</line></document><document name="NYT20000711.0211"><line>It's a free country.</line><line>But two upcoming cable specials may leave viewers wondering if too much freedom is a bad thing.</line><line>HBO's &quot;HATE.COM: Extremists on the Internet&quot;
